# User Interface Recommendations for Customers{#user-interface-recommendations-for-customers}

Adobe Experience Manager comes with two UIs - the unified Experience Cloud UI (also known as the touch-enabled UI) and the Classic UI.

This document is intended to guide customers to make a choice on what UI to use depending their situation.

Terms of interest:

* **UI (or standard UI)**
  Modern user interface that was introduced in 5.6.0 as a technology preview and extended in subsequent releases. It is based on the unified user experience for the Adobe Experience Cloud, formerly known as touch-enabled UI or touch UI.

* **Classic UI**
  User interface based on ExtJS technology that was introduced with CQ 5.1 in 2008.

* **Site Admin**
  Capabilities to manage the site hierarchy (move, activate, managed references) and create new pages.

* **Page Authoring**
  Capabilities to add/edit the content of a page.

* **DAM/Assets Admin**
  Capabilities to manage digital assets (including images, video, documents, downloads).

* **ContextHub**
  Capabilities to aggregate information about the visitor and use it for various purposes. Provides an user interface to simulate persons visiting the site. Starting AEM 6.2, ContextHub replaced the previous technology, Client Context.

## General {#general}

Over the last few years Adobe has updated all the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions with an unified user interface. Users across the Experience Cloud solutions enjoy a consistant experience with common patterns on how to use and operate the applications. With every release, Adobe has refined its user interface based on feedback from customers working across the various solutions.

The original user interface for Adobe Experience Manager (previously known as CQ5), introduced in 2008 and used by customers running versions 5.0-5.6.1, is present in AEM 6.5. This guarantees that customers can update to 6.5, and benefit from an updated platform with new capabilities while keep using the same user interface.

Adobe recommends customers to plan to switch to the new UI in 2018/19. This can either be done during the update to 6.5 - or in a separate projects after the update, that would include the necessary adjustments to the customizations and component dialogs.

The Classic UI was deprecated with AEM 6.4 and Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to the Classic UI. Note that Classic UI remains fully supported while being deprecated.
