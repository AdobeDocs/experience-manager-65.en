# Analytics with External Providers {#analytics-with-external-providers}

Analytics can provide you with important and interesting information about how your website is being used.

Various out-of-the box configurations are available for integrating with the appropriate service, for example:

* [Adobe Analytics](/help/sites-administering/adobeanalytics.md)
* [Adobe Target](/help/sites-administering/target.md)

You can also configure your own instance of the **Generic Analytics Snippets** to define a new service configurations.

The information is then collected by means of small snippets of code that are added to the web pages. For example:

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Scripts must not be enclosed in `script` tags.

```
var _gaq = _gaq || [];
_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXX-X']);
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

(function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'https://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
})();
```

Such snippets enable data to be collected and reports generated. The actual data collected depends on the provider and the actual code snippet used. Example statistics include:

* how many visitors over time
* how many pages visited
* search terms used
* landing pages

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The Geometrixx-Outdoors demo site is configured so that the attributes provided in the Page Properties are appended to the html source code (just above the `</html>` endtag) in the corresponding `js` script.
>
>If your own `/apps` do not inherit from the default page component ( `/libs/foundation/components/page`) you (or your developers) have to make sure that the corresponding `js` scripts are included, for example by either including `cq/cloudserviceconfigs/components/servicescomponents`, or using a similar mechanism.
>
>Without this, none of the services (Generic, Analytics, Target, etc) will work.

   ![](assets/analytics_snippet.png)

1. Click **OK** to save.

## Using your new Service on Pages {#using-your-new-service-on-pages}

Having created the service configuration you now need configure the required pages to use it:

1. Navigate to the page.
1. Open the **Page Properties** from sidekick, then the **Cloud Services** tab.
1. Click **Add Service**, then select the required service; for example the **Generic Analytics Snippet**:

   ![](assets/analytics_selectservice.png)

1. Click **OK** to save.
1. You will be returned to the **Cloud Services** tab. The **Generic Analytics Snippet** is now listed with the message `Configuration reference missing`. Use the drop down list to select your specific service instance; for example google-analytics:

   ![](assets/analytics_selectspecificservice.png)

1. Click **OK** to save.

   The snippet can now be seen if you view the Page Source for the page.

   After a suitable period of time has elapsed, you will be able to view the statistics that have been collected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the configuration is attached to a page that has child pages, the service is inherited by those as well.
