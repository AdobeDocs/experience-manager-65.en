# Integrating with Adobe Campaign{#integrating-with-adobe-campaign}

Adobe Campaign is a set of solutions that lets you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels.

You can integrate this version of AEM with one of the following versions of Adobe Campaign:

* Adobe Campaign 6.1, which is the on-premise solution.
* Adobe Campaign Standard, which is the subscription-based solution.

This documentation describes how to integrate AEM with Adobe Campaign. Depending on whether you have the subscription-based or on-premise solution, the integration steps will differ slightly.
