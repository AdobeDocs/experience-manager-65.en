# Integrating with Adobe Campaign{#integrating-with-adobe-campaign}

Lean about AEM as a Cloud Service's support for integrations with Adobe Campaign.

Adobe Campaign is a set of solutions that lets you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels.

## Integrating with Adobe Campaign Classic {#acc}

There are a number of Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC) versions. The support for integration with AEM depends on the ACC version you have implemented and if AEM is installed on-premises on in Adobe Manage Services (AMS).

|[v8](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-v8.html)|Supported|Supported|

*The Web UI for Adobe Campaign Classic is anticipated by the end of 2023.
