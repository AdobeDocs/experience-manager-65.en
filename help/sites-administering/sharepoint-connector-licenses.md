     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

     1. Definitions.

        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.

        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.

        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement").
     Please read the terms and conditions of this Agreement carefully.
     *Content Repository for Java^TM Technology API Specification
     ("Specification")
     Version: 1.0
     Status: FCS
     Release: 11 May 2005 *

     Copyright 2005 Day Management AG
     Barfüsserplatz 6, 4001 Basel, Switzerland.
     All rights reserved.

     *NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS*

     *1. License for Purposes of Evaluation and Developing Applications*.
     Licensor hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive,
     non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the right to
     sublicense), under Licensor's applicable intellectual property rights to
     view, download, use and reproduce the Specification only for the purpose
     of internal evaluation. This includes developing applications intended
     to run on an implementation of the Specification provided that such
     applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the
     Specification.

     *2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations*. Licensor
     also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
     fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to
     sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the
     provisions of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the
     Specification to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation
     of the Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification
     including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not
     modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or
     include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
     fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those
     required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being
     implemented; and (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including
     satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such
     Specification ("Compliant Implementation"). In addition, the foregoing
     license is expressly conditioned on your not acting outside its scope.
     No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for
     example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your
     fair use rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).

     *3. Pass-through Conditions*. You do not need to include limitations (a)-(c)
     from the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through"
     requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your
     Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However, except
     with respect to Independent Implementations (and products derived from
     them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You
     may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any
     licenses under Licensor's applicable intellectual property rights; nor
     (b) authorize your licensees to make any claims concerning their
     implementation's compliance with the Specification.

     *4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses*. With respect to any patent
     claims covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that
     would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the
     Specification, such license is conditioned upon your offering on fair,
     reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from
     You, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license
     under Your patent rights that are or would be infringed by all
     technically feasible implementations of the Specification to develop,
     distribute and use a Compliant Implementation.

     *5. Definitions*. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent
     Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
     neither derives from any of Licensor's source code or binary code
     materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from
     Licensor, includes any of Licensor's source code or binary code
     materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall mean the public class or
     interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax",
     "javax.jcr" or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention
     adopted by Licensor through the Java Community Process, or any
     recognized successors or replacements thereof; and "Technology
     Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying
     TCK User's Guide provided by Licensor which corresponds to the
     particular version of the Specification being tested.

     *6. Termination*. This Agreement will terminate immediately without
     notice from Licensor if you fail to comply with any material provision
     of or act outside the scope of the licenses granted above.

     *7. Trademarks*. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks,
     service marks, or trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is
     a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States
     and other countries.

     *8. Disclaimer of Warranties*. The Specification is provided "AS IS".
     LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
     IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A
     CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION), OR
     THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE.
     This document does not represent any commitment to release or implement
     any portion of the Specification in any product.

     The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical
     errors. Changes are periodically added to the information therein; these
     changes will be incorporated into new versions of the Specification, if
     any. Licensor may make improvements and/or changes to the product(s)
     and/or the program(s) described in the Specification at any time. Any
     use of such changes in the Specification will be governed by the
     then-current license for the applicable version of the Specification.

     *9. Limitation of Liability*. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
     EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
     REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
     FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN

     LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT").  PLEASE READ THE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY. BY
     DOWNLOADING THIS SPECIFICATION, YOU ACCEPT THE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. IF
     YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS,
     SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS
     PAGE AND THE DOWNLOADING PROCESS WILL NOT

     Java(TM) Portlet Specification ("Specification")
     Version: 1.0
     Status: FCS
     Specification Lead: Sun Microsystems, Inc. and IBM
     Corporation (collectively "Specification Lead")
     Release: August 29, 2003

     Copyright 2003 Sun Microsystems, Inc. and IBM
     Corporation
     All rights reserved.

     NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS

     Specification Lead hereby grants you a fully-paid,
     non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
     limited license (without the right to sublicense),
     under the Specification Lead's applicable
     intellectual property rights to view, download,
     use and reproduce the Specification only for the
     purpose of internal evaluation, which shall be
     understood to include developing applications
     intended to run on an implementation of the
     Specification provided that such applications do
     not themselves implement any portion(s) of the
     Specification.

     Specification Lead also grants you a perpetual,
     non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty
     free, limited license (without the right to
     sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or
     patent rights it may have in the Specification to
     create and/or distribute an Independent
     Implementation of the Specification that: (i)
     fully implements the Spec(s) including all its
     required interfaces and functionality; (ii) does
     not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend
     the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or
     protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
     fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space
     other than those required/authorized by the
     Specification or Specifications being implemented;
     and (iii) passes the TCK (including satisfying the
     requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide)
     for such Specification. The foregoing license is
     expressly conditioned on your not acting outside
     its scope. No license is granted hereunder for any
     other purpose.

     You do not need to include limitations (i)-(iii) from
     the previous paragraph or any other particular
     "pass through" requirements in any license You
     grant concerning the use of your Independent
     Implementation or products derived from it.
     However, except with respect to implementations of
     the Specification (and products derived from them)
     that satisfy limitations (i)-(iii) from the
     previous paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or
     otherwise pass through to your licensees any
     licenses under Specification Lead's applicable
     intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize
     your licensees to make any claims concerning their
     implementation's compliance with the Spec in
     question.

     For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent
     Implementation" shall mean an implementation of
     the Specification that neither derives from any of
     Specification Lead's source code or binary code
     materials nor, except with an appropriate and
     separate license from Specification Lead, includes
     any of Specification Lead's source code or binary
     code materials; and "Licensor Name Space" shall
     mean the public class or interface declarations
     whose names begin with "java", "javax", "com.sun"
     or their equivalents in any subsequent naming
     convention adopted by Specification Lead through
     the Java Community Process, or any recognized
     successors or replacements thereof.

     This Agreement will terminate immediately without
     notice from Specification Lead if you fail to
     comply with any material provision of or act
     outside the scope of the licenses granted above.
