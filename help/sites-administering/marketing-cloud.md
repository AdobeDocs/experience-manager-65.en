# Integrating with the Adobe Marketing Cloud{#integrating-with-the-adobe-marketing-cloud}

The [Adobe Marketing Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing.html), includes powerful web analytics and website optimization products that deliver actionable, real-time data and insights to drive successful online initiatives. It offers an integrated and open platform for online business optimization. The Cloud consists of integrated applications to collect and unleash the power of customer insight to optimize customer acquisition, conversion and retention efforts as well as the creation and distribution of content.

With Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), you can seamlessly integrate with the following products of the Adobe Marketing Cloud:

* Adobe Analytics provides marketers with actionable, real-time intelligence about online strategies and marketing initiatives.  
* Adobe Target gives marketers the ability to continually make their online content more relevant to their customers — yielding greater conversion.
* Adobe Scene7 automates media management, streamlines web publishing, and enhances web experiences, all in a hosted environment.
* Adobe Dynamic Tag Management gives marketers intuitive tools to quickly and easily manage an unlimited number of Adobe and third-party tags.
* Adobe Search&Promote gives marketers the ability to control and optimize the search results on their sites.

In addition, you can integrate AEM with the [creative cloud](/help/sites-administering/creative-cloud.md) and with [third-party services](/help/sites-administering/third-party-services.md).

## Integrating with Adobe Analytics {#integrating-with-adobe-analytics}

[Adobe Analytics](https://www.omniture.com/en/products/analytics/sitecatalyst) is the industry-leading solution that provides digital marketers with one place to measure, analyze, and optimize integrated data from all online initiatives across multiple marketing channels. It provides marketers with actionable, real-time web analytics intelligence about digital strategies and marketing initiatives. Adobe Analytics helps marketers quickly identify the most profitable paths through a website, segment traffic to spot high-value web visitors, determine where visitors are navigating away from the site, and identify critical success metrics for online marketing campaigns.

You can use Adobe Analytics to analyze data from your sites.

Integrating with Adobe Analytics allows you to do the following:

* Enable Analytics user tracking.
* Map your run modes (for example author, publish) to different report suites.
* Submit Client Context variables as conversion variables or traffic properties.
* Use predefined variable mappings.
* Configure complete site sections at once.
* Track custom-defined events.

For information about integrating AEM with Analytics, see [Integrating with Adobe Analytics](/help/sites-administering/adobeanalytics.md).

You can also use the [Opt-in wizard](/help/sites-administering/opt-in.md) to easily perform the integration.

## Integrating with Adobe Target {#integrating-with-adobe-target}

[Adobe Target](https://www.omniture.com/en/products/conversion/test-and-target) is used by marketers to design and execute online tests, create on-the-fly audience segments (based on behavior) and automate the targeting of content and online experiences.

Online consumers today have constantly evolving needs and expect relevant, even personalized content from the wide variety of sites and content sources they can choose from. To engage an online audience, it is critical that online marketers quickly identify which offers and content are relevant and compelling to their audiences. Armed with this knowledge, marketers need the capability to continually evolve their sites and to target the appropriate content to different audiences.

[Integrating with Adobe Target](/help/sites-administering/target.md) explains how to integrate your site with Target.

You can also use the [Opt-in wizard](/help/sites-administering/opt-in.md) to easily perform the integration.
