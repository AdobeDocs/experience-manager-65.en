# Enabling Access to Classic UI{#enabling-access-to-classic-ui}

With touch-enabled functionality reaching parity with and in fact exceeding that of the classic UI in many areas of AEM, access to the classic interface through the touch-enabled interface is now disabled by default. The following pages explain how to re-enable this access if necessary.

* [Editor](/help/sites-administering/enable-classic-ui-editor.md)
* [Admin Consoles](/help/sites-administering/enable-classic-ui-admin.md)

>[!NOTE]

>For details on the status of feature parity with the classic UI, see the [Touch UI Feature Parity](/help/release-notes/touch-ui-features-status.md) document.
