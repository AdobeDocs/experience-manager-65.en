# Creating a Language Root Using the Classic UI{#creating-a-language-root-using-the-classic-ui}

The following procedure uses the classic UI to create a language root of a site. For more information, see [Creating a Language Root](/help/sites-administering/tc-prep.md#creating-a-language-root).

1. In the Websites console, in the Websites tree, select the root page of the site. ([http://localhost:4502/siteadmin#](http://localhost:4502/siteadmin#))
1. Add a new child page that represents the language version of the site:

    1. Click New > New Page.
    1. In the dialog, specify the Title and the Name. The Name needs to be in the format of `<language-code>` or `<language-code>_<country-code>`, for example en, en_US, en_us, en_GB, en_gb.

        * The supported language code is lower-case, two-letter code as defined by ISO-639-1
        * The supported country code is lower-case or upper-case, two-letter code as defined by ISO 3166

    1. Select the Template and click Create.

   The Language Copy dialog displays a matrix of available language versions and web pages. An x in a language column means that the page is available in that language.

1. To copy an existing page or page tree to a language version, select the cell for that page in the language column. Click the arrow and select the type of copy to create.

   In the following example, the equipment/sunglasses/irian page is being copied to the French language version.

   | `<language>+` (e.g. French+) |Copies the page and all its children from that language |
   | `<language>` (e.g. French) |Copies only the page from that language |

1. Click OK to close the dialog.
1. In the next dialog, click Yes to confirm the copy.
