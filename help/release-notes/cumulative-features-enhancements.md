### [!DNL Forms]

* **New Adaptive Form Core Components**: Vertical tabs, Terms & Conditions, and Checkbox are added to enhance the scalability of forms.
  * **[Checkbox component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/checkbox.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a checkbox component. It allows users to make binary choices, selecting or deselecting a particular option. It typically appears as a small box that can be clicked or tapped to toggle between two states: checked and unchecked. The checkbox is a common form element used to present a yes/no or true/false choice.

  * **[Terms and Conditions component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/terms-and-conditions.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a Terms and Conditions component. It allows Forms authors to introduce a specific section within the form where users are presented with the terms, conditions, or legal agreements associated with the use of a service, product, or platform. This component is designed to inform users about the rules, regulations, and obligations they are agreeing to by submitting the form.

By harnessing its inherent capability to access larger memory resources compared to its 32-bit counterpart, XMLFM 64-bit empowers seamless handling of larger rendering workloads. This milestone not only represents a leap in performance but also introduces key enhancements to the native service framework within the AEM Forms Server. This update equips AEM Forms Server to seamlessly support any 64-bit native service.
