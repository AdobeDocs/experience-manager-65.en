# Touch UI Feature Status {#touch-ui-feature-status}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.4 onwards [Classic UI is deprecated](../release-notes/deprecated-removed-features.md). Adobe is not making any more enhancements to the Classic UI and users are encouraged to use the powerful new features available in the touch-enabled UI.

Starting with version 6.0, AEM introduced a new user interface referred as the "touch-enabled UI" (called "Touch UI") that is aligned to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] and to the overall Adobe user interface guidelines. With near feature parity reached, this has become the standard UI in AEM with the legacy, desktop-oriented interface referred to as "classic UI".

While most capabilities are present in the touch-enabled UI, there are features that are not yet complete and will be added in future releases.

The following list shows the status of the capabilities as implemented in AEM 6.5.

For recommendations for customers that upgrade to AEM 6.5, see [User interface recommendations for customers](/help/sites-deploying/ui-recommendations.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This page only covers feature parity with classic UI. Capabilities added to and unique to the Touch-enabled UI that are not present in the Classic UI are not listed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This list strives to be complete, but is not exhaustive.
