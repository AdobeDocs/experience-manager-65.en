## What's New {#what-s-new}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5 is an upgrade release to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.4 code base. It provides new and enhanced functionality, key customer fixes, high priority customer enhancements and general bug fixes oriented toward product stabilization. It also includes [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.4 Service Pack releases up to SP4.

The list below provides an overview - while the subsequent pages list the full details.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Foundation] {#experience-manager-foundation}

Full list of changes in [AEM Foundation](/help/release-notes/wcm-platform.md).

The platform of [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5 build on top of updated versions of the OSGi-based framework (Apache Sling and Apache Felix) and the Java Content Repository: Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.10.2.

The Quickstart uses Eclipse Jetty 9.4.15 as servlet engine.

#### Java Support  {#java-support}

* New support for Java 11, as well as the already supported Java 8.
* For optimal performance, override default GC values with other values. For more information, see the [install and update](/help/sites-deploying/custom-standalone-install.md) section.
* Java 11 and Java 8 maintenance updates are distributed by Adobe for customer usage in AEM-related projects, when not publicly available from Oracle.

#### Java Development {#java-development}

* There are now [two versions of the Uberjar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md#experience-manager-api-dependencies), a recommended version with public interfaces that are not marked for deprecation, as well as a version that includes interfaces marked for deprecation.

#### User Interface {#user-interface}

Various enhancements have been made to the UI to make it more productive and easier to use.

* New Permissions Management UI for Users and Groups.
* Column Views now also only loads entries that are visible on the screen and only loads more when the user is starting to scroll. List and Card view already did that since 6.0 (improved in 6.4).
* Column Views now include the workflow status for pages/assets when applicable.
* The [Select All](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#select-all) action is a quick way to execute an action with all pages/assets in the same folder.
* The [Select All](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#select-all) action attempts to perform the action to all pages/assets, not just what has been loaded. A warning dialog is displayed if the action is not upgraded to handle Bulk Actions.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to the Classic UI. AEM 6.5 has the Classic UI included, and customers upgrading from earlier releases can keep using it as is. Note that Classic UI remains fully supported while being deprecated. [Read more](/help/sites-deploying/ui-recommendations.md).

#### Search and Indexing {#indexing-and-search}

* Search in Oak now supports dynamic facets. For example, the filter rail in assets search show the estimated amount of results.
* QueryBuilder was extended to provide results with dynamic facets.

#### Upgrade {#upgrade}

* Direct in-place upgrade to AEM 6.5 is supported for customers running AEM 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4. Customers using 5.x or 6.0/6.1 that want to use in-place upgrade need to upgrade to 6.4 first - and then upgrade to 6.5, or upgrade via transfer of the content between the instances directly to AEM 6.5.

#### Projects and Workflows {#projects-and-workflows}

* New Workflow Model editor introduced in 6.4 has been improved to include more operations like Copy and Publish, Variable support in Workflow steps and enhanced OR and AND splits.

### [!DNL Experience Manager] Sites {#experience-manager-sites}

Full list of changes in [AEM Sites and Add-ons](/help/release-notes/sites.md).

#### Managed Single-page Apps {#managed-single-page-apps}

The Page Editor adds the ability to in-context edit content and compose/layout within client-side rendered experiences (also known [as SPA Editor](/help/sites-developing/spa-architecture.md)). Existing single-page apps build with JavaScript framework React or Angular can be extended with the AEM SJ SDK to be made editable for practitioners.

First shipped as part of AEM 6.4 SP2, with AEM 6.5 the SPA support gains following capabilities:

* Use Template Editor to edit and configure the AEM editable parts of the SPA
* Use Multi-site Management to create country, franchise or white-labeled SPA experiences

#### Headless Content Management {#headless-content-management}

AEM has the ability to serve the content in various formats and from various levels of the stack. Some have been around since 2008 with the [Sling GET](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/rendering-content-default-get-servlets.html) and [POST Servlet](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/manipulating-content-the-slingpostservlet-servlets-post.html). Content Services ([Sling Model Exporter](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/foundation/development/develop-sling-model-exporter.html)) was introduced in AEM 6.3 and is the method used by the AEM SJ SDK to hydrate single-page apps. The [HTTP API for Assets](/help/assets/mac-api-assets.md) is a CRUD API, that was extended for AEM 6.5.

New HTTP API capabilities:

* Added [Content Fragment support to HTTP API for Assets](/help/assets/assets-api-content-fragments.md) to create, update, read and delete fragments.
* Expose lists of Content Fragments via Content Services with the [Content Fragment List Core Component](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-core-wcm-components/library/content-fragment-list.html).
* [Core Component Library](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-core-wcm-components/library.html) that shows the default Content Services JSON output for each component

#### Screens Add-on {#screens-add-on}

Efficiently design, deliver and optimize experiences on all digital displays from interactive kiosks to digital signage.

**Design**

Introduction of [Adobe Asset Link](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/adobe-asset-link.html), an in-app experience for creative users working in Adobe Creative Cloud applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, streamlines collaboration between creatives and marketers in the content creation process. AEM desktop app continues to support the needs of users working with assets from AEM on desktop, using any file type and any desktop application.

### Leverage Customer-focused Development {#leverage-customer-focused-development}

Adobe is using a customer focused development model that allows customers to contribute to all stages of the development process, during specification, development and testing. Our thanks goes to all contributing customers and partners in this process.

Adobe has the procedures and processes in place to enable collection, prioritization, and tracking of customer focused bug resolution and enhancement request development. The [Adobe Marketing Cloud Support Portal](https://helpx.adobe.com/contact/enterprise-support.ec.html) is integrated with the Adobe Enhancement and Defect Tracking System. Customer questions are identified and resolved with Customer Care where possible. When escalated to R&D, all customer information is captured, and used for prioritization and reporting purposes. Priority is given in development to paid support, warrantee issues, and customer-paid enhancements.

This process of prioritization has yielded more than 750 customer focused changes fixed in AEM 6.5.
