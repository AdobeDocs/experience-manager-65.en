## Install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0{#install}

<!-- Remaining content from here to bottom stays the same except for version updating as needed as per update team feedback. -->

* [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0 requires [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5. See [upgrade documentation](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. <!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->
* The Service Pack download is available on Adobe [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/servicepack/aem-service-pkg-6.5.22.0.zip).
* On a deployment with MongoDB and multiple instances, install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0 on one of the Author instances using the Package Manager.<!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Adobe does not recommend that you remove or uninstall the [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0 package. As such, before you install the pack, you should create a backup of the `crx-repository` in case you must roll it back. <!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->
<!-- For instructions to install Service Pack for Experience Manager Forms, see [Experience Manager Forms Service Pack installation instructions](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-current-service-pack-installation-instructions.md). -->

### Install the Service Pack on [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5{#install-service-pack}

1. Restart the instance before installation if the instance is in update mode (when the instance was updated from an earlier version). Adobe recommends a restart if the current uptime for an instance is high.

1. Before installing, take a snapshot or a fresh backup of your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance.

1. Download the Service Sack from [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/servicepack/aem-service-pkg-6.5.22.0.zip). <!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

1. Open Package Manager, then select **[!UICONTROL Upload Package]** to upload the package. To know more, see [Package Manager](/help/sites-administering/package-manager.md).

1. Select the package, then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

1. To update the S3 connector, stop the instance after installation of the Service Pack, replace the existing connector with a new binary file provided in the install folder, and restart the instance. See [Amazon S3 Data Store](/help/sites-deploying/data-store-config.md#upgrading-to-a-new-version-of-the-s-connector).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The dialog box on the Package Manager UI sometimes exits during the installation of the Service Pack. Adobe recommends that you wait for error logs to stabilize before accessing the deployment. Wait for the specific logs related to the uninstall of the updater bundle before being assured that the installation is successful. Typically, this issue occurs in the [!DNL Safari] browser but can intermittently occur in any browser.

**Automatic installation**

There are two different methods that you can use to install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0.<!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

* Place the package into `../crx-quickstart/install` folder when the server is available online. The package is automatically installed.
* Use the [HTTP API from Package Manager](/help/sites-administering/package-manager.md#package-share). Use `cmd=install&recursive=true` so that the nested packages are installed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Experience Manager 6.5.23.0 does not support Bootstrap installation. <!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

**Validate the installation**

To know the platforms that are certified to work with this release, see the [technical requirements](/help/sites-deploying/technical-requirements.md).

1. The product information page (`/system/console/productinfo`) displays the updated version string `Adobe Experience Manager (6.5.23.0)` under [!UICONTROL Installed Products]. <!-- UPDATE FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

1. All OSGi bundles are either **[!UICONTROL ACTIVE]** or **[!UICONTROL FRAGMENT]** in the OSGi Console (Use Web Console: `/system/console/bundles`).

1. The OSGi bundle `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core` is version 1.22.20 or later (Use Web Console: `/system/console/bundles`). <!-- OAK Oak oak VERSION -MAY- NEED TO BE UPDATED FOR EACH NEW RELEASE. CHECK WITH SAMEER DHAWAN -->

### Install Service Pack for [!DNL Experience Manager] Forms{#install-aem-forms-add-on-package}

For instructions to install the Service Pack on Experience Manager Forms, see [Experience Manager Forms Service Pack installation instructions](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-current-service-pack-installation-instructions.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Adaptive Forms feature, available in [AEM 6.5 QuickStart](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/deploying/deploy), is designed for exploration and evaluation purposes only. For production use, it is essential to obtain a valid license for AEM Forms, as Adaptive Forms functionality requires proper licensing.

### Install GraphQL Index Package for Experience Manager Content Fragments{#install-aem-graphql-index-add-on-package}

Customers using GraphQL must install the [Experience Manager Content Fragment with GraphQL Index Package 1.1.1](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/featurepack/cfm-graphql-index-def-1.1.1.zip). 

Doing so lets you add the required index definition based on the features they actually use.

Failure to install this package may result in slow or failed GraphQL queries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only install this package once per instance; it does not need to be reinstalled with every Service Pack.

### UberJar{#uber-jar}

The UberJar for [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.23.0 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.5.22/). <!-- CHECK FOR UPDATE EACH NEW RELEASE -->

To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md) and include the following dependency in your project POM: <!-- CHECK FOR UPDATE EACH NEW RELEASE -->

  ```shell
    <dependency>
    <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
    <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
    <version>6.5.23</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>          
    </dependency>
  ```

>[!NOTE]
>
>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.adobe.com`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.



## Deprecated and removed features{#removed-deprecated-features}

See [Deprecated and removed features](/help/release-notes/deprecated-removed-features.md/).



## Known issues{#known-issues}

<!-- THESE KNOWN ISSUES CARRY OVER EACH RELEASE. THE "PRODUCT UPDATES TEAM" IS SUPPOSED TO VERIFY EACH ISSUE AND LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE ADDED, DELETED, OR CHANGED IN THIS LIST.-->

<!-- * **Page publishing not working in Page Editor after upgrading to Service Pack 18 (6.5.18.0)** -->

  <!-- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SITES-15856 REMOVE FOR 6.5.19.0 --> 
  <!-- After you upgrade an instance of AEM 6.5.0.0&mdash;6.5.17.0 to AEM 6.5.19.0, when you click **Publish Page** inside the Page Editor, you are redirected to a URL that does not exist.

  To work around this issue, do one of the following:

  * Remove the following "path" property.

       `/libs/wcm/core/content/editor/jcr:content/content/items/content/header/items/headerbar/items/pageinfopopover/items/list/items/publish/granite:data`

  * Paste the correct URL directly into the browser.

       `http://localhost:4504/editor.html/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/publishpagewizard.html?item=/content/we-retail/language-masters/en/about-us.html` -->


* **Related to Oak**
  From Service Pack 13 and above, the following error log has begun to appear which affects the persistence cache:

  ```shell
  org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.0.202/5]
  at org.h2.mvstore.DataUtils.newMVStoreException(DataUtils.java:1004)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.getUnsupportedWriteFormatException(MVStore.java:1059)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.readStoreHeader(MVStore.java:878)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.<init>(MVStore.java:455)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore$Builder.open(MVStore.java:4052)
      at org.h2.mvstore.db.Store.<init>(Store.java:129)
  ```

  Or

  ```shell
  org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.1.214/5].
  ```

  To resolve this exception, do the following:

    1. Delete the following two folders from `crx-quickstart/repository/`

        * `cache`
        * `diff-cache`

    1. Install the Service Pack, or restart Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. 
      New folders of `cache` and `diff-cache` are automatically created and you no longer experience an exception related to `mvstore` in the `error.log`.

* Update your GraphQL queries that may have used a custom API name for your content model to use the default name of the content model instead.

* A GraphQL query may use the `damAssetLucene` index instead of the `fragments` index. This action might result in GraphQL queries that fail, or take a long time to run.

  To correct the problem, `damAssetLucene` has to be configured to include the following two properties under `/indexRules/dam:Asset/properties`:

  * `contentFragment`
    * `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    * `name="jcr:content/contentFragment"`
    * `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    * `type="Boolean"`
  * `model`
    * `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    * `name="jcr:content/data/cq:model"`
    * `ordered="{Boolean}true"`
    * `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    * `type="String"`

  After the index definition is changed, a reindexing is required (`reindex` = `true`).

  After these steps, the GraphQL queries should perform faster.

* When trying to move, delete, or publish either Content Fragments, Sites, or Pages, there is an issue when Content Fragment references are fetched. The background query fails. That is, the functionality does not work.
  To ensure correct operation, you must add the following properties to the index definition node `/oak:index/damAssetLucene` (no reindexing is required):

   ```xml
   "tags": [
       "visualSimilaritySearch"
     ]
   "refresh": true
   ```

* If you upgrade your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance from 6.5.0 - 6.5.4 to the latest Service Pack on Java&trade; 11, you see `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. To stop the exceptions, restart your instance of [!DNL Experience Manager]. <!-- THIS BULLET POINT WAS UPDATED AS PER CQDOC-20021, JANUARY 23, 2023 --> 

* Users can rename a folder in a hierarchy in [!DNL Assets] and publish a nested folder to [!DNL Brand Portal]. However, the title of the folder is not updated in [!DNL Brand Portal] until the root folder is republished.

* The following errors and warning messages may be displayed during installation of [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.x.x:
  * "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in [!DNL Experience Manager] using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type "Experience Fragment"/source "Adobe Experience Manager," Target creates several offers with type "HTML"/source "Adobe Target Classic."
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler`: No maintenance windows found at `granite/operations/maintenance`.
  * Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN are used (CQ-4274424).
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler` : No maintenance windows found at `granite/operations/maintenance`.
  * The hotspot in a Dynamic Media interactive image is not visible when previewing the asset through the Shoppable Banner viewer.
  * `com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider bundle com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider:1.3.5 (395)[com.adobe.cq.social.provider.jcr.impl.SpiSocialJcrResourceProviderImpl(2302)]` : Timeout waiting for register change to complete unregistered.

* Starting with AEM 6.5.15, the Rhino JavaScript Engine provided by the ```org.apache.servicemix.bundles.rhino``` bundle has a new hoisting behavior. Scripts that use the strict mode (```use strict;```) have to declare their correct variables. Otherwise, they do not get run, and end up throwing a runtime error.
 
* Installing tagging related out-of-the-box content by way of an official update package resets the languages property of the `/content/cq:tags` node to default. This action is true for Service Packs, Security Service Packs, Extended Feature Packs, Cumulative Feature Packs, patches, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to add it from the properties before installation.

### Known issue for AEM Sites {#known-issues-aem-sites-6523}

* Content Fragments-Preview fails due to DoS protection for a large tree of fragments. See the [KB article about Default GraphQL Query Executor configuration options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/ka-23945) (SITES-17934)



### Known issues for AEM Forms {#known-issues-aem-forms-6523}

* If the HTML to PDF conversion fails on a SUSE&reg; Linux&reg; (SLES 15 SP6 onwards) server with the following error:
  
  ```Auto configuration failed 4143511872:error:0E079065:configuration file routines:DEF_LOAD_BIO:missing equal sign:conf_def.c:362:line 57```
  then set the following environment variable and restart the server:
    `OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl`

* After installing AEM Forms JEE Service Pack 21 (6.5.21.0), if you find duplicate entries of Geode jars `(geode-*-1.15.1.jar and geode-*-1.15.1.2.jar)` under the `<AEM_Forms_Installation>/lib/caching/lib` folder (FORMS-14926), perform the following steps to resolve the issue:

  1. Stop the locators, if they are running.
  1. Stop the AEM Server. 
  1. Go to the `<AEM_Forms_Installation>/lib/caching/lib`. 
  1. Remove all the Geode patch files except `geode-*-1.15.1.2.jar`. Confirm that only the Geode jars with `version 1.15.1.2` are present.
  1. Open the command prompt in administrator mode.  
  1. Install the Geode patch using the `geode-*-1.15.1.2.jar` file. 

* If a user tries to preview a draft letter with saved XML data, it gets stuck in `Loading` state for some specific letters. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (FORMS-14521)
  
* After upgrading to AEM Forms Service Pack 6.5.21.0, the `PaperCapture` service fails to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) operations on PDFs. The service does not generate output in the form of a PDF or a log file. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (CQDOC-21680)

* When users upgraded from AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 18 or 19 to Service Pack 20 or 21, they encountered a JSP compilation error. This error prevented them from opening or creating adaptive forms. It also caused issues with other AEM interfaces. Those interfaces included the page editor, AEM Forms UI, Workflow editor, and System Overview UI. (FORMS-15256)

  If you face such an issue, perform the following steps to resolve it:
    1. Navigate to the directory `/libs/fd/aemforms/install/` in CRXDE.
    1. Delete the bundle with the name `com.adobe.granite.ui.commons-5.10.26.jar`.
    1. Restart your AEM Server.

* After updating to AEM Forms Service Pack 20 (6.5.20.0) with the Forms Add-On, configurations relying on the legacy Adobe Analytics Cloud Service using credential-based authentication stop working. This issue prevented analytics rules from executing correctly. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (FORMS-15428)

* When a user updates to AEM Forms Service Pack 20 (6.5.20.0) on the JEE server and generates PDFs using output services, the PDFs render with accessibility issues. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3922112)
* When a user generates Tagged PDFs using the output service on JEE, it shows "Inappropriate structure warning." To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3922038)
* When a form is submitted on AEM Forms JEE, the instances of a repeating XML element are removed from the data. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3922017)
* When a user in a Linux&reg; environment renders an adaptive form (on JEE) in HTML, it fails to render properly. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3921957)
* When a user converts an XTG file to PostScript format using the Output Service on AEM Forms JEE, it fails with the error: `AEM_OUT_001_003: Unexpected Exception: PAExecute Failure: XFA_RENDER_FAILURE`. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3921720)
* After upgrading to AEM Forms Service Pack 18 (6.5.18.0) on JEE server, when a user submits a form, it fails to render HTML5 or PDF Forms and XMLFM crashes. To download and install the hotfix, refer to the [Adobe Experience Manager Forms Hotfixes](/help/release-notes/aem-forms-hotfix.md#hotfix-for-adaptive-forms) article. (LC-3921718)
* In the Print Preview of the Interactive Communications Agent UI, the currency symbol (such as the dollar sign $) is inconsistently displayed for all field values. It appears for values up to 999 but is missing for values of 1000 and above. (FORMS-16557)
* Any modifications to nested layout fragments' XDP in an Interactive Communication are not reflected in the IC editor. (FORMS-16575)
* In the Print Preview of the Interactive Communications Agent UI, some calculated values are not displayed correctly. (FORMS-16603)
* When the letter is viewed in Print Preview, the content is changed. That is, some spaces disappear, and certain letters are replaced with 'x'. (FORMS-15681)
* When a user configures a WebLogic 14c instance, the PDFG service in AEM Forms Service Pack 21 (6.5.21.0) on JEE running on JBoss&reg; fails due to classloader conflicts involving the SLF4J library. The error is displayed as follows (CQDOC-22178):
  
    ```java
    Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.getLoggerFactory()Lorg/slf4j/ILoggerFactory;"
