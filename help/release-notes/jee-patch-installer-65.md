1. Stop your application server.
1. Extract the patch installer archive file to your hard drive.
1. In the directory named according to the operating system that you are using:

    * **Windows** 
      Navigate to the appropriate directory on the installation media or folder on your hard disk where you copied the installer, and double-click the aemforms65_cfp_install.exe file.

      * (Windows 32-bit) `Windows\Disk1\InstData\VM`
      * (Windows 64-bit) `Windows_64Bit`\ `Disk1\InstData\VM`

    * **Linux&reg;** 
      Navigate to the appropriate directory, and from a command prompt, type `./aem65_cfp_install.bin`.

      * (Linux&reg;) `Linux/Disk1/InstData/NoVM`

   This launches an install wizard that guides you through the installation.

1. On the Introduction panel, click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. On the **Choose Install Folder** screen, verify that the default location displayed is correct for your existing installation, or click **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to select the alternate folder where AEM forms is installed, and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. Read the Quick Fix Patch Summary information and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
1. Read the Pre-Installation Summary information and click **[!UICONTROL Install]**.
1. When the installation is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to apply the quick fix updates to your installed files.  

1. **[For Windows only]:** Do the following:
   * Either deselect the **Start Configuration Manager** option before you click **[!UICONTROL Done]**. Run **Configuration Manager** by using the **ConfigurationManager.bat** file in `[aem-forms root]\configurationManager\bin`. 

   * Or deselect the **Start Configuration Manager** option before you click **[!UICONTROL Done]**. Before running **Configuration Manager** using **ConfigurationManager.exe** or **ConfigurationManager_IPv6.exe**, navigate to *`<AEMForms_Install_Dir>\configurationManager\bin`* directory and replace [ConfigurationManager.lax](/help/assets/ConfigurationManager.lax) and [ConfigurationManager_IPV6.lax](/help/assets/ConfigurationManager_IPv6.lax) files.

   >Using **ConfigurationManager.bat** file helps you to avoid updating name of .lax files manually.
