# What's new in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Pack 8 {#aem-whats-new-service-pack}

![Whats-new](assets/whatsnew.jpeg)

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Packs provide new features, customer-requested enhancements, and performance, stability, and security improvements at quarterly intervals. The quarterly availability makes it easy to access and adopt new features and innovations.

This article highlights the features included in the latest Service Pack, [key features included in the previous 6.5 Service Packs](#key-features-previous-service-packs), and the [key releases since the last Service Pack](#key-releases-since-last-sp) release.

## [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Sites] {#aem-sites}

### Sort the Live Copy pages available for rollout {#sort-livecopy-pages}

You can now sort the Live Copy pages available for rollout using the [!UICONTROL Name], [!UICONTROL Last modified date], and [!UICONTROL Last rollout date] properties. The [!UICONTROL Last rollout date] for a page is a new property introduced in this release.

## [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] {#aem-assets}

* When using [Connected Assets functionality](/help/assets/use-assets-across-connected-assets-instances.md), you can now view a list of all the [!DNL Sites] pages that use the asset. These references to an asset are available in an asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page. This allows administrators, marketers, and librarians a complete view of assets usage, allowing for better tracking, management, and brand consistency.

* When deleting an asset that is referenced in a web page, [!DNL Experience Manager] displays a warning. You can force delete a referenced asset or check and modify the references that are displayed in the [!DNL Properties] page of the asset. Clicking the references opens the local and remote [!DNL Sites] pages.

## [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Forms] {#aem-forms}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The add-on package of [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] is made available a week after the scheduled [!DNL Experience Manager] Service Pack release.

#### Configure [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] with [!DNL Brand Portal] (6.5.4.0) {#configure-assets-bp}

The authorization channel between [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] and [!DNL Brand Portal] is changed. Earlier, [!DNL Brand Portal] was configured in Classic UI via Legacy OAuth Gateway, which uses the JWT token exchange to obtain an IMS Access token for authorization. [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] is now configured with [!DNL Brand Portal] through [!DNL Adobe I/O], which procures an IMS token for authorization of your [!DNL Brand Portal] tenant.

The steps to configure [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] with [!DNL Brand Portal] are different depending on your [!DNL Experience Manager] version, and whether you are configuring for the first time, or upgrading the existing configurations. See [Configure Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-brand-portal/using/publish/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html) for details.

#### Accessibility enhancements (6.5.4.0) {#accessibility-enhancements}

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] includes the following accessibility enhancements:

* Arrow keys on keyboard can be used to move and pan areas within zoomed images. For more information, see [preview assets using keyboard keys only](../assets/manage-assets.md#previewing-assets).

* The mixed state checkboxes (in which unless you select all the nested predicates the first-level checkboxes are not selected and are stricken through) in Filters panel are readable by screen readers.

* Date and time format constraints are provided in field labels of date fields, to enable the users to enter the date in correct format using keyboard.
For example, `On Time (MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm)`. Here MM is month in two-digit format, YYYY is year, DD is day in two-digit format, HH is hour in 24-hour military format, and mm is minute.

* Screen readers announce the option to remove selected tags (`X` symbol) and the number of the selected tags.

#### Sortable column for Created date of assets in list view (6.5.3.0) {#sortable-date-created-column}

A new sortable column for created date of assets is added in DAM list view and on asset search results in list view.

![Sortable column for date created](assets/asset-created-date.png)

#### Visual search for [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] (6.5.2.0) {#visual-search}

[!DNL Assets] users can search visually similar images. Experience Manager displays the smart tagged images from the DAM repository that are similar to a user-selected image. See [Visual search](../assets/search-assets.md).

### Dynamic Media {#dynamic-media-previous-service-packs}

#### Invalidate CDN cached content (6.5.6.0) {#invalidate-cdn-cached-content}

You can now use the [!DNL Dynamic Media] user interface to invalidate Content Delivery Network (CDN) cached content. As a result, the updated assets are available instantly instead of waiting for the cache to expire. You can invalidate CDN by:

#### Smart Imaging for Dynamic Media {#smart-imaging}

Smart imaging uses each user's unique viewing characteristics to automatically serve the right images optimized for their experience, resulting in better performance and engagement. Smart imaging works with your existing image presets and uses intelligence at the last millisecond of delivery to further reduce image file size based on browser or network connection speed. See [Smart Imaging](../assets/imaging-faq.md).

#### Smart crop in video profiles for Dynamic Media (6.5.3.0) {#smart-crop-video}

Smart crop for video–an optional feature available in Video Profiles– is a tool that uses the power of artificial intelligence in Adobe Sensei to automatically detect and crop the focal point in any adaptive video or progressive video that you have uploaded, regardless of size. See [About using smart crop in video profiles](../assets/video-profiles.md).

### Experience Manager Forms {#aem-forms-previous-service-packs}
