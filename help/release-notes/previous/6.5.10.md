# [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.10.0 {#experience-manager-65100}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.10.0 includes new features, key customer-requested enhancements, and performance, stability, and security improvements, that are released since the availability of 6.5 release in April 2019. The service pack is installed on [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.

The key features and enhancements introduced in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.10.0 are:

* **Enhanced [!DNL Content Fragment] Models and Editor**: You can now create complex and custom models for structured content using nested [!DNL Content Fragment] models. Content structures are modularized into basic elements that are modeled as sub-fragments. Higher-level fragments reference these sub-fragments. More data type enhancements such as advanced validation rules further enhance the flexibility of content modeling with [!DNL Content Fragments]. The [!DNL Experience Manager] [!DNL Content Fragment] editor supports nested fragment structures in a common editor session, with enhancements such as structure tree view and tabbed breadcrumb navigation through fragment hierarchies.

* **GraphQL API for [!DNL Content Fragments]**: The new GraphQL API is the standard method to deliver structured content in JSON format. GraphQL queries let clients request only the relevant content items to render an experience. Such a selection eliminates content over-delivery (possibility with HTTP REST APIs) that requires content parsing on the client side. GraphQL schemas are derived from [!DNL Content Fragment] models, and API responses are made in JSON format.

* **GraphQL API for [!DNL Content Fragments]**: To support GraphQL API, hyphens are no longer allowed in the Content Fragment Model Property Field. GraphQL queries might return unwanted results if a hyphen is present in any of the Content Fragment Model property names. 
Only the following characters are allowed for property name: A-Za-z0-9_. A digit cannot be in the first position.

* **Hierarchy management and future preview**: Users now have an interface to access the content structures of their [!DNL Experience Manager] launches, including the ability to add and remove pages in a launch. This feature enhances the flexibility of [!DNL Experience Manager] launches to author content versions targeted for future publishing. [Time-warp feature](/help/sites-authoring/working-with-page-versions.md#timewarp) lets users preview launches as future content states.

* **Connected Assets**: [!DNL Experience Manager] extends the [!DNL Connected Assets] functionality to the use of [!DNL Dynamic Media] images in the applicable core components. See [use Connected Assets](/help/assets/use-assets-across-connected-assets-instances.md).

* **Link share options to download assets or renditions**: When sharing assets and Collections as link, users can choose whether to allow the download of original assets, or their renditions, or both using the shared link. Also, the users who download the assets shared with them through link get the option to download only the original assets, only the renditions, or both. See [Share assets via link](/help/assets/link-sharing.md).

  ![option to allow download only original assets, only the renditions, or both](/help/release-notes/assets/share-assets-as-link.png)

* **Limit sub-assets generated**: Administrators can limit the number of sub-assets that [!DNL Experience Manager] generates for compound assets such as PDF, PowerPoint, InDesign, and Keynote files. See [Manage compound assets](/help/assets/managing-linked-subassets.md#generate-subassets).

  ![limit the sub-asset generation](/help/assets/assets/sub-asset-limit.png)


* **Camera Raw support**: A new [!DNL Camera Raw] package is available that supports [!DNL Adobe Camera Raw] v10.4. See [process images using [!DNL Camera Raw]](/help/assets/camera-raw.md).

* The built-in repository (Apache Jackrabbit Oak) is updated to 1.22.8.

* **Accessibility enhancements**:

  * [!DNL Dynamic Media] provides many accessibility enhancements for Viewers. See [[!DNL Dynamic Media] updates](#dynamic-media-65100).

  * Platform provides a few accessibility enhancements. See [Platform updates](#platform-65100).

* **User experience enhancements**:

  * [!DNL Experience Manager] directly displays a list of all the content models under a folder without content authors having to navigate through the file structure. The feature now requires fewer clicks and improves authoring efficiency.

  * Pathfield in [!DNL Sites] editor allows authors to drag assets from [!DNL Content Finder].

* Added support for `GuideBridge#getGuidePath` API in [!DNL AEM Forms].

* You can now use Automated Forms Conversion service to [convert PDF Forms in French, German, Spanish, Italian, and  Portuguese languages](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/aem-forms-automated-conversion-service/using/extending-the-default-meta-model.html#language-specific-meta-model) to adaptive forms.

* **Error messages in Properties browser**: Added error messages for each property in the Adaptive Forms Properties browser. These messages help understand allowed values for a field.

* **Support to use the literal option to set value for a JSON type variable**: You can use literal option to set value for a JSON type variable in the set variable step of an AEM Workflow. The literal option allows you to specify a JSON in the form of a string.

* [Platform Updates](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md): [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Forms] on JEE has added support for the following platforms:
  * [!DNL Adobe Acrobat 2020]
  * [!DNL Ubuntu 20.04]
  * [!DNL Open Office 4.1.10]
  * [!DNL Microsoft Office 2019]
  * [!DNL Microsoft Windows Server 2019]
  * [!DNL RHEL8]

The following is the list of fixes provided in [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.10.0 release.

## [!DNL Sites] {#sites-65100}

* The focus shift to another field when typing in the **[!UICONTROL Default Value]** field under the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab of the Content Fragment Editor (NPR-36992).

* While filtering [!DNL Content Fragment] models under a specified path, [!DNL Experience Manager] search returns all nodes with `cq:Template` instead of returning paths and nodes only for the [!DNL Content Fragment] model (SITES-1453).
* [!DNL Content Fragments] return `null` as the status of folders (SITES-1157).
* [!DNL Experience Manager] does not let users disable and enable [!DNL Content Fragment] Models (SITES-1088).
* When a user moves, rename, or deletes [!DNL Content Fragments] or media assets, the referenced [!DNL Content Fragments] are not automatically updated (SITES-196).
* Pasting components from one page to another produces JavaScript errors (NPR-37030).
* When page properties are viewed quickly, Page Properties for a different page are opened (NPR-37025).
* The Content Fragment allows the Content Fragment to reference itself. The picker does not support the operation (NPR-36993).
* After upgrading to service pack 9, some users cannot move folders in Experience Manager and see errors in the logs (SITES-1481).
* While adjusting the width of the component in the layout container on edit mode, a flicker is observed (NPR-36961).
* On promoting a launch, the changes in the promoted launch are double rolled out to the other launches. If a user promotes the double rolled out launch, the doubled contents is reflected on the source page (NPR-36893).
* [!DNL Experience Manager] adds a gray border to some PNG images with transparency if you add the images to a page using the Image Core Component or if you resize using the Foundation Image component (NPR-36879).
* [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] Admin UI with a high number of templates results in slow navigation (NPR-36870).
* Webpages fail to render when their links are modified by custom servlet filter bundles and so on. (NPR-36857) <!-- Note updated as per CQDOC-19203, April 07, 2022 -- >
* The `ContextHubImpl` method creates a `ResourceResolver` that is not closed. It leads to warning messages about long-running `ResourceResolver` and the service returns unexpected results at times (NPR-36853).
* On synchronizing a single live copy from blueprint page properties, all other live copies are also synchronized (NPR-36829, NPR-36522).
* When only XLS MIME type is used, the file upload function does not work as expected (NPR-36785).
* New tags with pascal case and all upper case words are not displayed in the tag field within [!DNL Content Fragments] (NPR-36742).
* The Single Text Element option when adding a [!DNL Content Fragment] causes text to be missing and creates odd formatting related to lists and nested lists (NPR-36565).
* When an author annotates any component on a page, deletes the component, and performs an undo on the delete operation, an error is encountered when attempting to view the Timeline data for the page in the sites console (NPR-36528).
* Page properties Bulk Editor's [!UICONTROL Save & Close] option saves changes but does not close the editor (NPR-36527).
* When a user attempts to drag and drop a new Text component to a page, the component immediately disappears (NPR-36442).
* When a user types in an on-demand tag that includes space (the tag that does not exist on the system) and presses enter, the tag appears under the field. However, when the [!DNL Content Fragment] is saved and reopened, the on-demand tag does not appear (NPR-36441).
* The template cannot be deleted when the instance is accessed via the Dispatcher (NPR-36385).
* When a page is moved, a manual refresh of the browser is required to render the changes (NPR-36381).
* When selecting a component, you can cut or copy it with Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C (and Command+X or Command+C on Mac). When you click another component, you can paste with the toolbar, but not the keyboard (Ctrl+V or Command+V) (NPR-36379).
* When a user tries cut components using the scissor icon to move them somewhere else, a console error happens. Moreover, when pasting only one component gets moved (NPR-36378).
* [!DNL Experience Manager] has a query without index on WCM or notifications, it slows down performance (NPR-36303).
* When an author restores the inheritance on the deleted inherited component, the available option is to synchronize all page content. The content authors are required to sync the complete page even if the inheritance is restored only on one component. A complete sync can result in unwanted content getting synchronized (NPR-34456, CQ-4310183).
* Live Usage of a component on Author instance does not display all the occurrences. Some components are used in more than 1000 pages but the report only displays about 40 pages (CQ-4323724).
* When there is a site structure that has lot of subpages, loading of the subpages in column view takes more time in Experience Manager 6.5.8 as compared to Experience Manager 6.4.8.2 (CQ-4322766).
* Uncheck 'All' does not work on the 'Rollout Page' option (NPR-37070).
* When opening an existing v3 component version of a page, the page Properties dialog does not open and a `NullPointerException` is logged (SITES-1830).                                 

## [!DNL Assets] {#assets-65100}

The following issues are fixed in [!DNL Assets]:

* The value of the property `jcr:title` is not updated on the Publish instance after a folder is moved. Renaming and republishing a folder within author does not update the `jcr:title` property value of the same in the Publish instance (NPR-36369).

* If two or more assets are selected and one or more metadata fields are edited, the save operation fails with error code 500 in Safari browser (NPR-36413).

* When searching for files and folders, if user applies a filter and selects [!UICONTROL Files & Folders], only the files are displayed but not the folder (CQ-4319543, NPR-36627).

* The toolbar options are different when the same Collection is selected from within a folder and when it is selected from a search result (NPR-36620).

* The [!UICONTROL Quick Publish] option is not available on the search results page (NPR-36904, CQ-4317748).

* When users create live copy of an asset without specifying its extension, then after download the live copy file is not usable (NPR-36903, CQ-4326305).

* When a user is added as an owner of a child folder, then the user gets owner permission of its parent folder too and hence of the other children folders of the parent. Also, the user is not removed as owner of parent folder on attempting to remove it. (NPR-36801, CQ-4323737).

* [!DNL Experience Manager] generates an out-of-memory exception when you attempt to create sub-assets for compound assets, such as a PowerPoint presentation (NPR-36668).

* When users move an asset that is already used in a published sites page, then the sites page is published again even if the option to publish is not selected (NPR-36636, CQ-4323500).

* When using the Apache Tika MIME type detection feature, the assets uploaded using the `AssetManager.createAsset` method leave a temporary file named `apache-tika-*.tmp` file in the temporary directory. This temporary file uses all the available free disk space (NPR-36545).

* All DRM-protected assets are downloaded and user selection to download specific asset is not followed (CQ-4327422).

## UberJar {#uber-jar}

The UberJar for Experience Manager 6.5.10.0 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.5.10/).

To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md) and include the following dependency in your project POM:

```shell
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
     <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
     <version>6.5.10</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.maven.apache.org`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.

## Known issues in Experience Manager 6.5.10.0 {#known-issues}

<!-- REMOVED AS PER CQDOC-20022, JANUARY 23, 2023 * If you install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Pack 10 or a previous service pack on [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5, the runtime copy of your assets custom workflow model (created in `/var/workflow/models/dam`) is deleted.
To retrieve your runtime copy, Adobe recommends to synchronize the design-time copy of the custom workflow model with its runtime copy using the HTTP API:
`<designModelPath>/jcr:content.generate.json`. -->

* As [!DNL Microsoft Windows Server 2019] does not support [!DNL MySQL 5.7] and [!DNL JBoss EAP 7.1], [!DNL Microsoft Windows Server 2019] does not support turnkey installations for [!DNL AEM Forms 6.5.10.0].

* If you are upgrading your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance from 6.5 to 6.5.10.0 version, you can view `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. To resolve the issue, restart the instance.



* Users can rename a folder in a hierarchy in [!DNL Assets] and publish a nested folder to [!DNL Brand Portal]. However, the title of the folder is not updated in [!DNL Brand Portal] until the root folder is republished.

* When a user selects to configure a field for the first time in an adaptive form, the option to save a configuration does not display in Properties Browser. Selecting to configure some other field of the adaptive form in the same editor resolves the issue.

* The following errors and warning messages may display during installation of Experience Manager 6.5.x.x:
  * "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in Experience Manager using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type "Experience Fragment"/source "Adobe Experience Manager," Target creates several offers with type "HTML"/source "Adobe Target Classic."
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler`: No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN are used (CQ-4274424).
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler` - No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Hotspot in a Dynamic Media interactive image is not visible when previewing the asset through Shoppable Banner viewer.
