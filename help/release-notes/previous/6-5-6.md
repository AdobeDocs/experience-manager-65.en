# [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.6.0 {#experience-manager-6560}

Adobe Experience Manager 6.5.6.0 is an important update that includes new features, key customer requested enhancements, and performance, stability, and security improvements, that are released since the general availability of 6.5 release in **April 2019**. It can be installed on top of Adobe Experience Manager 6.5.

The key features and enhancements introduced in Adobe Experience Manager 6.5.6.0 includes:

* Selectively publish or unpublish assets to either [!DNL Experience Manager] or [!DNL Dynamic Media] using [!UICONTROL Quick Publish] or [!UICONTROL Manage Publication] wizard.

* Use the [!DNL Dynamic Media] user interface to invalidate Content Delivery Network (CDN) cached content.

* Publishing the asset contribution folders from Brand Portal to Experience Manager Assets is now supported through proxy server as well.

* User groups associated with folders (private and non-private) are now removed from the repository on [deletion of those folders](/help/assets/private-folder.md#delete-private-folder). However, the existing redundant, orphaned, unused, and auto-generated user groups can be removed from the repository using JMX.

* The descriptions of modifiers in video [!UICONTROL Viewer] preset editor has been updated in [!DNL Dynamic Media].

* A new company setting is provided to reflect the status of [!DNL Dynamic Media] connector.

* The default options for `test` and `aiprocess` are updated to `Thumbnail`, from `Rasterize` previously in Dynamic Media, to ensure that users need to create only thumbnail and skip the page extraction and keyword extraction. 

* [Prefill an adaptive form at the client](/help/forms/using/prepopulate-adaptive-form-fields.md#prefill-at-client).

* [Form data model integration with RESTful APIs on a server with two-way SSL implementation](/help/forms/using/configure-data-sources.md).

* [Enhanced caching for translated adaptive form pages](/help/forms/using/configure-adaptive-forms-cache.md).

* Support for [Adobe Sign Text Tags in Automated Forms Conversion Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/aem-forms-automated-conversion-service/using/convert-existing-forms-to-adaptive-forms.html).

* Support to [convert colored forms to adaptive forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/aem-forms-automated-conversion-service/using/convert-existing-forms-to-adaptive-forms.html) using [!DNL Automated Forms Conversion service].

* Support for SMB 2 and SMB 3 protocols.

* The built-in repository (Apache Jackrabbit Oak) is updated to version 1.22.4.

The following is the list of fixes provided in [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.6.0 release.

## [!DNL Sites] {#sites-6560}

* In [!DNL Sites] or [!DNL Screens], select a Project and click [!UICONTROL Management Publications]. Users cannot advance in the [!UICONTROL Manage Publication] wizard due to user interface errors. Specifically, the [!UICONTROL Publish] option does not work (NPR-34099).
* The position of iParsys (Inherited Paragraph System) is not reverted to its original default position after deselecting [!UICONTROL Cancel Inheritance] or [!UICONTROL Disable Inheritance] options (NPR-34097).
* If the `RolloutConfigManagerFactoryImpl` is not able to load a rollout config, it does not attempt to load the missing configs. It returns the cached configurations (NPR-34092).
* In Text core component, after using source HTML edit option, the class from `em` tag is removed (NPR-34081).
* After upgrading from Experience Manager 6.3.3 to Experience Manager 6.5.3, the roll-out process takes much longer and the rollout fails with a timeout error (NPR-34049).
* The `htmlwriter` does not encode back the attribute values. The markup that is present in the XF markup is exported with decoded attribute values (namely `"` instead of `&#34`). It causes issues on the Target side with Visual Experience Composer that uses the XF exported (NPR-34048).
* When moving pages in [!DNL Experience Manager Sites], enhance the logging to capture the version creation failure with reason (NPR-34014).
* In [!DNL Rich Text Editor] if all text is removed then the paragraph tag gets removed as well (NPR-33976).
* When the `siteadmin` page (in Classic UI) is opened or refreshed, the options in the `New` menu are disabled (NPR-33949).

  ![Screenshot to illustrate the issue of missing menu in Classic UI](/help/release-notes/assets/33949_missing_menu.png)

* A [!DNL Content Fragment] cannot be used as a `TemplatedResource` as it fails in `ContentFragmentUsePojo` (NPR-33911).
* Synchronous and asynchronous move operations can lead to errors due to concurrent transfers. Page move operations are restricted to asynchronous move only. It prevents concurrent move of pages (NPR-33875).
* [!UICONTROL Manage Publication] operation to replicate content from Author to Publish instance fails and generates a JavaScript error (NPR-33872).
* When multiple pages or assets are selected to create versions, the new version is created only for the last selected page or asset (NPR-33866).
* Move a blueprint page with live copies to another folder. When moving it to the original folder, the move operation fails without any error (NPR-33864).
* When move action is used to rename a web page in the [!DNL Sites] Console, it displays two overlapped dialogs at the last step of the wizard (NPR-33831).

  ![Screenshot to illustrate NPR-33831 issue of overlapping move dialog](/help/release-notes/assets/33831_rename_dialog.png)

* The `cq:acLinks` and `cq:acUUID` properties for [!DNL Adobe Campaign] on the copy are removed during copy and paste operation (NPR-33794).
* When attempting a rollout on a child page of a detached parent live copy, [!DNL Experience Manager] generates a null pointer exception (NPR-33676).
* The [!DNL RTE] components in a layout container are not visible when the layout container is copied and pasted again on the page. The [!DNL RTE] components are not editable but are displayed upon a page refresh (NPR-33662).
* When resizing a layout component for different breakpoints (medium and large), the layout does not behave as expected (NPR-33608).
* In inline editing mode in [!DNL RTE], dragging an image does not work for Text component (NPR-33602).
* It is possible to create a component in a blueprint page with the same name as the page name. During rollout, `_msm_moved` is suffixed to rename the component. The component is moved to the end of the [!UICONTROL Paragraph System] (NPR-33535).
* When offTime or onTime is set on many pages or assets, it is resource-intensive and slows the system during startup and shutdown (NPR-33482).
* A user with CRUD permissions on `/content/experience-fragment` is not able to delete a folder (NPR-33436).
* You can select [!UICONTROL HTML & JSON] as the option for [!UICONTROL Adobe Target export format] on a parent folder in [!DNL Experience Fragments] section. The same properties are displayed in Touch-enabled UI for the subfolders of this parent folder. However, in CRXDE, for `cq:adobeTargetExportFormat`, it displays just HTML instead of displaying `html,json` (NPR-33423).
* Publish or Unpublish from a Page Alias is not supported. Remove the option that seems to claim otherwise (NPR-33415).
* A specific tag can be moved from one location to another in [!DNL Experience Manager]. It can also be applied to different pages before and after moving. When editing the properties of the pages, the tag is not displayed for editing even though the tag is the same (NPR-33353).
* A page template does not render properly when a layout container is deleted from a template that contains multiple layout containers (NPR-33347).
* In the template editor, try to delete a template that is used by more than 100000 pages under `/content/`. An error is displayed without any error message (NPR-33312).
* Redirection to [!DNL Experience Manager] page with anchor does not work on Author instance as `PageRedirectServlets` puts query string after a URL fragment or an anchor (NPR-34288).
* Creating a brand under `/content/campaign` results in a structure that does not allow to create campaigns. [!UICONTROL Create Brand] option leaves the newly created brand without ability to create [!UICONTROL Offers and Activities] as there is no [!UICONTROL Create] option (NPR-34113).
* You can suspend the [!DNL Live Copy] of a page and inheritance are broken in as seen in the Editor mode. In the page properties, the icon representing inheritance incorrectly indicates that the inheritance exists and is not broken (NPR-34017).
* Pages with many references cannot be moved asynchronously and sometimes the move operation fails (CQ-4297969).
* A web page with `/` character in the URL becomes unresponsive while authoring. When a component is added while authoring, the CPU usage increases and browser stops responding (CQ-4295749).
* In the browse mode, NVDA does not narrate a value selected from Type/Size menu option. The visual focus is not on the selected element. User who rely on a screen reader cannot use the browse mode (CQ-4294993).
* When creating a web page, users can select [!UICONTROL Content Page] template. In the [!UICONTROL Social Media] tab, users select a [!UICONTROL Preferred XF variation]. To select an Experience Fragment in NVDA browse mode, users cannot use keyboard keys (CQ-4292669).
* Updated the handlebars library to the more secure v4.7.3 (NPR-34484).
* Multiple cross site scripting instances in [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] components (NPR-33925).
* The folder name field when creating a folder is vulnerable to stored cross site scripting (GRANITE-30094).
* The search results on the[!UICONTROL  Welcome] page and the path completion template are vulnerable to cross site scripting (NPR-33719, NPR-33718).
* Creating a binary property on an unstructured node results in cross site scripting on the binary property dialog (NPR-33717).
* Cross site scripting when using [!UICONTROL Access Control Test] option on the CRX DE interface (NPR-33716).
* User inputs are not appropriately encoded for various components when sending information to the client (NPR-33695).
* Cross site scripting in Calendar view for Experience Manager Inbox (NPR-33545).
* A URL that ends with `childrenlist.html` displays an HTML page instead of a 404 response. Such URLs are vulnerable to cross site scripting (NPR-33441).


## [!DNL Assets] {#assets-6560}

**Accessibility enhancements in Experience Manager Assets**

* Use of the `Esc` key to remove the quick action icons from card view no longer removes keyboard focus from the last focused item (CQ-4293554).

* For interactive options on the user interface, screen reader now announces their purpose rather than the literal names of the icons (CQ-4272943).

* Keyboard focus now successfully moves to [!UICONTROL Flyout], [!UICONTROL InlineZoom], [!UICONTROL Shoppable_Banner], [!UICONTROL Zoom_dark], [!UICONTROL Zoom_light], [!UICONTROL ZoomVertical_dark], and [!UICONTROL ZoomVertical_light] options when navigating using keyboard Tab key in asset details [!UICONTROL Viewers] in [!DNL Dynamic Media] (CQ-4290605).

**Issues fixed in Experience Manager Assets**

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.6.0 [!DNL Assets] provides fixes to the following issues:

* Annotations are not highlighted when selected from the asset's timeline (CQ-4302422).

* Preview of marketing collateral assets (such as Brochure, Flyer, and Business card) created using [!DNL Adobe InDesign] template does not display line breaks and paragraph breaks (NPR-34268).

* Text extraction and hence the full-text search for the uploaded PDF files does not work (NPR-34164). To fix it, restart the [!DNL sAdobe Experience Manager] deployment after installing Service Pack 6.

* Timeline of multi-page assets displays annotations applied to all the sub assets when browsing the asset in Timeline view, instead of displaying the annotations specific to the specific sub assets (NPR-34100).

* Assets folders are not getting published using [!UICONTROL Manage Publication] option if the folders contain resources in JavaScript, CSS, or JSON file formats (NPR-34090).

* Deselecting or removing the applied tags or filters in Omnisearch executes the search query multiple times, which leads to increase in the search time (NPR-34078).

* In card view when a workflow (on an asset in a folder) is in progress or pending, the page reloads until the workflow is complete or terminated. Therefore, authors cannot work on those assets in the folder for which they have to scroll down (NPR-33986).

* If user moves a published asset to a new location, then the asset gets republished even if [!UICONTROL Republish] option is deselected. This leads to many orphaned assets lying on the publish instance. The default behavior, however, is that move operation on a published asset automatically unpublishes it; this asset is republished if author selects the [!UICONTROL Republish] option when moving the asset (NPR-33934).

* The [!UICONTROL Move Assets] page for assets in collections does not load all the HTML content, such as [!UICONTROL Adjust/ Republish] option. Therefore, users cannot complete the move operation (NPR-33860).

* Moving an asset and adding special characters in the name and title of the moved assets creates an extra folder (with the same name) at the new location of the asset (NPR-33826).

* [!UICONTROL Download] button for an asset gets disabled when [!UICONTROL Email] option is selected on the [!UICONTROL Download] dialog (NPR-33730).

* The error ‘Request-URI too long’ is observed on performing bulk operations on assets, such as bulk metadata editing (NPR-33723).

* JavaScript error is observed and users cannot select or delete the choices generated in [!UICONTROL Dropdown] field by [!UICONTROL Add through JSON path] functionality in the [!UICONTROL Folder Metadata Schema Form Editor], if the uploaded JSON file has space or special characters in value (NPR-33712).

* The static renditions of assets are not updated when asset is updated using [!UICONTROL Open] option in [!DNL desktop app] or [!DNL Adobe Asset Link] and are synced back to [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (CQ-4296279).

* In column view the move operation on a set of assets also moves those assets which were selected before using [!UICONTROL Filter] option for them. Note that use of [!UICONTROL Filter] option deselects the previous selection (NPR-34018).

* Backslashes are added before special characters in search suggestions of assets, which have special characters in their name (NPR-33834).

* When creating rules for dropdown in [!UICONTROL Folder Metadata Schema Form], user cannot select values from [!UICONTROL Field Choices] column (CQ-4297530).

* The run-time copy of assets custom workflow model (created in `/var/workflow/models/dam`) is deleted when you install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Pack 5 or a previous version on [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5 (NPR-34532). To retrieve the run-time copy, sync the design-time copy of the workflow model with the run-time copy using HTTP API:
`<designModelPath>/jcr:content.generate.json`.

**Issues fixed in Dynamic Media**

* If user defines the encoding settings in edits after creating the video profile, then the smart crop settings are removed from video profiles (CQ-4299177).

* Assets flicker on page load when user toggles between side rail options (for example, [!UICONTROL Overview], [!UICONTROL Timeline], [!UICONTROL Viewers]) on asset details page (NPR-34235).

* Following issues are observed with reprocess job:

  * Job ID is missing in job handle returned by reprocess job.

  * Reprocess job for video logs only filename and not full path.
  
  * Reprocess job does not have option to set the asset type as static.

  * `ExcludeFromAVS` option is not provided (CQ-4298401).

* The Smart Crop functionality fails with error when image profile is added to a folder having multiple (for example, 11) aspect ratios (NPR-34082).

* DAM update assets workflow is triggered when user scrolls down on [!UICONTROL Workflow Archive] page on [!UICONTROL Workflow] tab within [!UICONTROL Tools] in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] configured with Dynamic Media Scene7 (CQ-4299727).

* Symbols in [!UICONTROL Behavior] tab of [!UICONTROL Viewer Preset Editor] are not localized (CQ-4299026).

* The main view displays image in incorrect layout that does not fit in viewer, if the viewer is in responsive mode (CQ-4298293).

* Changes to image presets in [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager] do not sync to Scene7 Publishing System (CQ-4299713).

## Platform {#platform-6560}

* Cannot download logs using the Diagnosis tool on an upgraded Experience Manager instance (NPR-34336).
* Upgrade fails with an error due to dependencies on a specific version of the `cq-wcm-api` foundation package (CQ-4300520).
* The default values for the **[!UICONTROL Connect Timeout]** and **[!UICONTROL Socket Timeout]** settings for the Default Agent (publish) configuration are not specified (NPR-33707).
* Updates to the mapping configuration under `/etc/map.publish` do not reflect on the site pages (NPR-34015).
* [API reference documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/day/cq/tagging/package-summary.html) does not include the documentation for the `com.day.cq.tagging` package (CQ-4295864).

## User Interface {#ui-6560}

* The Offloading Browser interface does not display all job topics (NPR-34308).
* The [Configuration Browser](/help/sites-administering/configurations.md) interface does not display all configurations (NPR-33644).
* On pressing the `Esc` key when searching for users to impersonate, the **[!UICONTROL User]** dialog closes instead of the user list (NPR-34084).

## Integrations {#integrations-6560}

* Activities with long names are not synchronized with [!DNL Adobe Target] (NPR-34254).

* Selecting a property while creating an Adobe Launch configuration results in the following error message (NPR-33947):

   ```javascript
   GET http://hostname:Port/libs/cq/dtm-reactor/content/configurations/createcloudconfigwizard/jcr:content/body/items/form/items/wizard/items/general/items/fixedcolumns/items/container/items/general/items/property/data.html?query=&start=0&end=25&imsConfigurationId=Adobe%20Launch&companyId=&_charset_=utf-8 400 (Bad Request)
   ```

## Translation Projects {#translation-6560}

* A translation project is not created if the user's `authorizableID` includes special characters (NPR-33828).

## Sling {#sling-6560}

* Health Check and Pattern Detector have overlapping functionality. As a result, Heath check is removed from the product (NPR-33928).

## WCM {#wcm-6560}

* Foundation Components - When you add a foundation image component to a page and reference an image, the `Undo` operation does not work (NPR-34516).

* Unable to use the Page Move operation (CQ-4303028).

## [!DNL Communities] {#communities-6560}

-->

## [!DNL Forms] {#forms-6560}

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Experience Manager] Service Pack does not include fixes for [!DNL Forms]. They are delivered using a separate [!DNL Forms] add-on package. In addition, a cumulative installer is released that includes fixes for [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] on JEE. For more information, see [Install AEM Forms add-on](#install-aem-forms-add-on-package) and [Install AEM Forms on JEE](#install-aem-forms-jee-installer).

After installing the [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] 6.5.6.0 add-on package:

* Stop the [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] instance.

* Delete `bcpkix-1.51`, `bcmail-1.51`, and `bcprov-1.51` JAR files from the `crx-repository\launchpad\ext` directory.

* The **[!UICONTROL Submit to REST endpoint]** submit action does not work for an adaptive form (CQ-4299044).

* Accessibility: When you try to submit an adaptive form without uploading an attachment for a mandatory field, the focus does not shift to the attachment field automatically (CQ-4298065).

* When you add rows to a table of an adaptive form, the **[!UICONTROL Add to top]** and **[!UICONTROL Add to bottom]** options does not display appropriate results (CQ-4297511).

* The [!UICONTROL Value Commit] script is triggered incorrectly, which results in data loss in an adaptive form (CQ-4296874).

* Date Picker does not work correctly for localized adaptive forms (NPR-34333).

* When there is an underscore or space in the filename, you are unable to attach the file to an adaptive form (CQ-4301001).

* When a nested repeatable panel has more occurrences than its parent, all the occurrences of such the nested repeatable panel fail to prefill (NPR-33666).

* Adaptive forms have some open resource resolvers. These lead to submission failures. The issue occurs intermittently (CQ-4299407).

* When you open the field configuration for the first time, the properties icon does not display (CQ-4296284).

* Users can edit submission metadata, such as `afPath`, `afSubmissionTime` and `signers`, when submitting an adaptive form. To resolve the issue, the metadata values are removed from the form submission data on the client side. Users can use the `FormSubmitInfo` object to retrieve these values from the server (NPR-33654).

* User inputs are not appropriately encoded for [!DNL Forms] components when sending information to the client (NPR-33611).

**Workflow**

For information on security updates, see [Experience Manager security bulletins page](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager.html).


### Enhanced caching for translated adaptive form pages (6.5.6.0) {#enhanced-caching-translated-adaptive-forms}

You can now specify [locale as a selector in the adaptive form URL instead of an argument in adaptive form URL](/help/forms/using/supporting-new-language-localization.md). It helps cache translated adaptive forms on [!DNL Experience Manager Dispatcher]. Caching translated adaptive form was not possible in previous versions. For detailed information about configuring caching for using locale as a selector in the adaptive form URL, see [Configure adaptive form cache at dispatcher](/help/forms/using/configure-adaptive-forms-cache.md).

### Save output of form data model service to a variable (6.5.6.0) {#save-fdm-service-to-variable}

Form data model lets you save output of a form data model service to a variable. [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] now automatically maps the type of the form data model service to the type of variable.

### Attach multiple files for File Attachment component (6.5.6.0) {#attach-multiple-files}

You can now [attach multiple files](/help/forms/using/introduction-forms-authoring.md) to the [!UICONTROL File Attachment] component of adaptive forms.

>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.maven.apache.org`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.
