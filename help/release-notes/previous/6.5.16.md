<!-- UPDATE BELOW FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

## [!DNL Assets] {#assets-6516}

* Connected Assets: When you enable the Smart Crop options for images on remote DAM, upload images to a folder, and sync the folder to local sites, the folder does not open on the local Sites deployment. (NPR-39912)

* When a large media file (JPEG) is uploaded to Collections, Experience Manager stops responding. (ASSETS-19387)
* In the content tree pane, the displayed asset name is incorrect as the location of the asset is not rendered appropriately. (ASSETS-18870)
* While sharing a Collection using a link, the data in the URL mismatches between the shuffle of card view and list view. (ASSETS-18758)
* When you perform an omnisearch by using a filter on the folder type, the search results are inconsistent. (ASSETS-18227)
* The `dam:size` property is not updated after XMP writeback, which results in incorrect information being returned from the `/platform/path/to/asset.jpg;resource=metadata` API. (ASSETS-17631)

## [!DNL Forms] {#forms-6516}

### [!DNL Forms] Key Features {#forms-features-6516}

* [Headless Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/using/overview.html) enable your developers to create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. 

*  [Adaptive Forms Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html#features) are a set of 24 open-source, BEM-compliant components that are built on the foundation of the Adobe Experience Manager WCM Core Components. These components are open-source and provide developers the ability to easily customize and extend these components to match the specific needs of their organization. Anyone with existing skills to customize [WCM Core components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/get-started/authoring.html?lang=en) can easily customize and style these components.

>
>In Experience Manager 6.5.16.0, the UberJar version (6.5.15.0) remains the same as the previous release.


To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md) and include the following dependency in your project POM: <!-- CHECK FOR UPDATE EACH NEW RELEASE -->

```shell
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
     <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
     <version>6.5.15</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.adobe.com`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.

## Deprecated features {#removed-deprecated-features}

Below is a list of features and capabilities that are marked as deprecated with [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.7.0. Features are marked deprecated initially and later removed in a future release. An alternate option is provided.

Review if you use a feature or a capability in a deployment. Also, plan to change the implementation to use an alternate option.

| Area | Feature | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| Integrations | The screen **[!UICONTROL AEM Cloud Services Opt-In]** is deprecated since the [!DNL Experience Manager] and [!DNL Adobe Target] integration is updated in [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5. The integration supports the Adobe Target Standard API. The API uses authentication by way of Adobe IMS and [!DNL Adobe I/O Runtime]. It supports the growing role of Adobe Launch to instrument [!DNL Experience Manager] pages for analytics and personalization, the opt-in wizard is functionally irrelevant. | Configure system connections, Adobe IMS authentication, and [!DNL Adobe I/O Runtime] integrations via the respective [!DNL Experience Manager] cloud services. |
| Connectors | The Adobe JCR Connector for Microsoft&reg; SharePoint 2010 and Microsoft&reg; SharePoint 2013 is deprecated for [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5. | N/A |

## Known issues {#known-issues}

<!-- THESE KNOWN ISSUES CARRY OVER EACH RELEASE. THE "PRODUCT UPDATES TEAM" IS SUPPOSED TO VERIFY EACH ISSUE AND LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE ADDED, DELETED, OR CHANGED IN THIS LIST.
 -->
<!-- REMOVED AS PER CQDOC-20022, JANUARY 23, 2023 * If you install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Pack 10 or a previous service pack on [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5, the runtime copy of your assets custom workflow model (created in `/var/workflow/models/dam`) is deleted.
To retrieve your runtime copy, Adobe recommends to synchronize the design-time copy of the custom workflow model with its runtime copy using the HTTP API:
`<designModelPath>/jcr:content.generate.json`. -->

* Update your GraphQL queries that may have used a custom API name for your content model to using the default name of the content model instead.

* A GraphQL query may use the `damAssetLucene` index instead of the `fragments` index. As such, it might result in GraphQL queries that fail, or take a long time to run.

  To correct the problem, `damAssetLucene` has to be configured to include the following two properties:

  * `contentFragment`
  * `model`

  After the index definition is changed, a reindexing is required (`reindex` = `true`).

  After these steps, the GraphQL queries should perform faster.

* When trying to move/delete/publish either Content Fragments or Sites/Pages, there is an issue when Content Fragment references are fetched, as the background query fails. That is, the functionality does not work.
  To ensure correct operation, you must add the following properties to the index definition node `/oak:index/damAssetLucene` (no reindexing is required):

   ```xml
   "tags": [
       "visualSimilaritySearch"
     ]
   "refresh": true
   ```

* As [!DNL Microsoft&reg; Windows Server 2019] does not support [!DNL MySQL 5.7] and [!DNL JBoss&reg; EAP 7.1], [!DNL Microsoft&reg; Windows Server 2019] does not support turnkey installations for [!DNL AEM Forms 6.5.10.0].

* If you upgrade your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance from 6.5.0 - 6.5.4 to the latest service pack on Java&trade; 11, you see `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. To stop the exceptions, restart your instance of [!DNL Experience Manager]. <!-- THIS BULLET POINT WAS UPDATED AS PER CQDOC-20021, JANUARY 23, 2023 --> 

* Users can rename a folder in a hierarchy in [!DNL Assets] and publish a nested folder to [!DNL Brand Portal]. However, the title of the folder is not updated in [!DNL Brand Portal] until the root folder is republished.

* When a user selects to configure a field for the first time in an adaptive form, the option to save a configuration does not display in Properties Browser. Selecting to configure some other field of the adaptive form in the same editor resolves the issue.

* The following errors and warning messages may display during installation of [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.x.x:
  * "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in [!DNL Experience Manager] using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type "Experience Fragment"/source "Adobe Experience Manager," Target creates several offers with type "HTML"/source "Adobe Target Classic."
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler`: No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN are used (CQ-4274424).
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler` - No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Hotspot in a Dynamic Media interactive image is not visible when previewing the asset through Shoppable Banner viewer.
  * `com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider bundle com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider:1.3.5 (395)[com.adobe.cq.social.provider.jcr.impl.SpiSocialJcrResourceProviderImpl(2302)]` : Timeout waiting for register change to complete unregistered.

* In AEM Forms, POP3 protocol does not work with email endpoints for Microsoft&reg; Office 365.
* On JBoss&reg; 7.1.4 platform, when a user installs AEM 6.5.16.0 service pack, `adobe-livecycle-jboss.ear` deployment fails. 
* Starting with AEM 6.5.15, the Rhino JavaScript Engine provided by the ```org.apache.servicemix.bundles.rhino``` bundle has a new hoisting behavior. Scripts that use the strict mode (```use strict;```) have to correctly declare their variables, otherwise they will not get executed, instead throwing a runtime error.
