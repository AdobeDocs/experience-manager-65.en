* _REVIEWERS: WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THIS RELEASE?_ -->

## Key features and enhancements

Some of the key features and enhancements in this release include the following:

* Enabled Sites Page Editor/Image Component user to reference assets from the remote Assets Cloud Service. (SITES-13448, SITES-13433) 
* AEM now supports server-side sorting for quicker project navigation in List view. Project nodes are sorted based on the user-selected column before appearing in the interface.

### [!DNL Forms]

* **New Adaptive Form Core Components**: Vertical tabs, Terms & Conditions, and Checkbox are added to enhance the scalability of forms.
  * **[Checkbox component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/checkbox.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a checkbox component. It allows users to make binary choices, selecting or deselecting a particular option. It typically appears as a small box that can be clicked or tapped to toggle between two states: checked and unchecked. The checkbox is a common form element used to present a yes/no or true/false choice.

  * **[Terms and Conditions component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/terms-and-conditions.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a Terms and Conditions component. It allows Forms authors to introduce a specific section within the form where users are presented with the terms, conditions, or legal agreements associated with the use of a service, product, or platform. This component is designed to inform users about the rules, regulations, and obligations they are agreeing to by submitting the form.

    ![Vertical tabs, Terms & Conditions and Checkbox components](/help/forms/using/assets/forms-components.png)

  * **[Vertical tabs component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/vertical-tabs.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now organize form content into a vertical list of tabs, providing a structured and navigable layout. The use of vertical tabs in a form can enhance the overall user experience by simplifying navigation and improving the organization of form content, especially in situations where a form contains multiple sections or complex information.
  
* **[64-bit version of AEM Forms Designer](/help/forms/using/installing-configuring-designer.md)**: The 64-bit version of AEM Forms Designer brings enhanced performance, scalability, and memory management to empower your form creation experience. With the 64-bit architecture, you can tackle even larger and more complex projects with ease, ensuring seamless design workflows and optimized efficiency. Elevate your form design capabilities and embrace the future of AEM Forms Designer with this cutting-edge release.

* **[Connect an Adaptive Forms with Microsoft&reg; SharePoint List](/help/forms/using/configuring-submit-actions.md#submit-to-microsoft&reg;-sharepoint-list)**: AEM Forms provide an out-of-the-box integration to submit forms data directly to SharePoint List, letting you use SharePoint's Lists capabilities. You can configure Microsoft&reg; SharePoint List as a datasource for a Form Data Model and use the Submit using Form Data Model submit action to connect an Adaptive Form with SharePoint List.

* **[Support to configure Document of Record properties for Adaptive Form Fragments](/help/forms/using/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.md)**: You can now easily customize your Adaptive Form fragments and its fields in  Adaptive Form editor.

* **64-bit XMLFM**: The 64-bit iteration of XMLFM introduces heightened performance, scalability, and refined memory management. It is the first 64-bit native service deployed on the server-side. By harnessing its inherent capability to access larger memory resources compared to its 32-bit counterpart, XMLFM 64-bit empowers seamless handling of larger rendering workloads. This milestone not only represents a leap in performance but also introduces key enhancements to the native service framework within the AEM Forms Server. This update equips AEM Forms Server to seamlessly support any 64-bit native service.


<!-- UPDATE BELOW FOR EACH NEW RELEASE -->

## Fixed issues in Service Pack 19 {#fixed-issues}

### [!DNL Sites]{#sites-6519}

#### Accessibility{#sites-accessibility-6519}

* On an AEM Sites page, when you zoom in 200% on the page, the links **[!UICONTROL Language Copy]** and **[!UICONTROL CSV Report]** in the References rail disappear. (SITES-11011)

#### Admin User Interface{#sites-adminui-6519}

* AEM Screens Channel **[!UICONTROL Preview]** functionality does not work or display on the Dashboard. (SITES-15730) 
* During a page move operation, if the user interface cannot display the references but states that these are automatically republished, they are *not* republished. (SITES-16435) 
* In AEM 6.5 with Service Pack 16 or 17, when in the List view of sites with the "Workflow" column enabled, you cannot sort the list based on the items in that column. No sorting occurs. (SITES-15385) 
* For a redirect page template, the redirect field has been made mandatory. However, the validation for the required field is not getting applied nor working in these two scenarios: when a page is created without a mandatory redirect value; cannot create a redirect page. The validation does not work when navigating using keyboard shortcuts and when the field is marked as invalid, it does not proceed. (SITES-15903) 
* Some **Incoming Links** were not getting included in the displayed count in the **References** panel. For example, the panel was showing **Incoming Links (6)** but there were actually nine incoming links. (SITES-14816) 

#### Classic UI{#sites-classicui-6519}

* After installing hotfix in SITES-15827, dialog box titles that had whitespace between words were getting replaced with `" "`. Line breaks were also being removed. (SITES-16089) 
* Encoded dialog box titles are now resulting in a double encoding of the title. (SITES-15841) 
* Update of AEM servers from service pack 6.5.16 to 6.5.17 resulted in a double encoding of Classic UI dialog box titles. (SITES-15634) 

#### [!DNL Content Fragments]{#sites-contentfragments-6519}

* An Internal Server Error message appears in the Content Fragment Editor. (SITES-13550) 
* The update of the `org.json` library by way of NPR-41291 caused data error conversions in the `DefaultDataTypeConverter` of the `cfm-impl` bundle. Data type conversion must be more flexible. (SITES-16473) 
* Getting the error pop-up message, "This content fragment version cannot be compared to the current version because of incompatible content." Content fragments should be comparable but it is not. (SITES-16317) 
* Changed the asset selector JS URL from 
`https://experience.adobe.com/solutions/CQ-assets-selectors/assets/resources/assets-selectors.js` 
to 
`https://experience.adobe.com/solutions/CQ-assets-selectors/static-assets/resources/assets-selectors.js` (SITES-16068) 
* Adapt new Polaris metadata API response schema for CFM-Polaris integration. (SITES-15166) 
* All content fragments should be listed where the selected content fragment is referenced. Instead, asset references in the content fragment reference panel show 0(zero) references. (SITES-15036) 

#### Core Backend{#sites-core-backend-6519}

* On the signature component (`/apps/fpl/components/campaign/signature`), the link Externalizer was not working. The domain was not getting appended to the image source, if the HTML comment above the image tag was removed. This issue was found only with the signature component in the production environment, not the staging environment. (SITES-16120) 

<!--#### Experience Fragments{#sites-experiencefragments-6519}

* A -->

#### Foundation Components (Legacy){#sites-foundation-components-legacy-6519}

* Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Sites Search component breaks the user interface. (SITES-15087) 

#### GraphQL Query Editor{#sites-graphql-query-editor-6519}

* GraphQL Editor user interface does not let you scroll through all the persisted queries when there is a high number of queries (for example, more than 25). (SITES-16008) 
* The GraphQL Editor is not saving the publishing status of persisted queries. The unpublish button appears in the GraphQL Editor, but the icon that indicates that the persisted query is published does not appear. Refreshing the page shows that the persisted query is not even published. (SITES-15858) 

#### Launches{#sites-launches-6519}

* Changes in the repository are not save due to `Oak0001` conflicts when multiple pages are being edited or content is being authored. It is normal to perform a retry in such an event but this does not occur. (SITES-14840) 

#### MSM - Live Copies{#sites-msm-live-copies-6519}

* MSM Rollout Button does not work in the touch graphical user interface. (SITES-16991) 
* Link Reference does not get updated inside Experience Fragment when creating a live copy or rolling out an Experience Fragment. (SITES-15460) 

#### Page Editor{#sites-pageeditor-6519}

* In Forms > Themes, if you opened a theme in the theme editor and made a few changes and saved, then clicked Preview, a loading icon is visible but the actual preview does not load. (SITES-17164)
* Selection of multiple document filetypes on asset type filter is not working on the page console. No results are found even if the results of one particular filetype are available. As a result, authors are unable to filter multiple documents. They must use multiple document types and they are having to filter it one at a time. (SITES-14047) 
* After upgrading an instance from AEM 6.5.17 and AEM 6.5.18, from inside the Page Editor, if you selected **[!UICONTROL Publish Page]**, you are redirected to a URL that does not exist. The user should be redirected to the Publish wizard. (SITES-15856) 
* Redundant copy from AEM's Clipboard during a paste from the operating system's Clipboard. (SITES-15704) 
* In Assets, selecting **[!UICONTROL Documents]**, then under **[!UICONTROL Filtertype]**, selecting **[!UICONTROL Microsoft&reg;&reg; Word]** or **[!UICONTROL Microsoft&reg;&reg; Excel]** shows no results even though files of both types exist. (SITES-14837) 

### [!DNL Assets]{#assets-6519}

* When you create or save a public folder, three groups are created in an admin dashboard. (ASSETS-26700) 
* Unable to differentiate publishing assets to Experience Manager or Brand Portal. (NPR-41320) 
* In the search panel, when you select checkboxes and deselect any one of them, all the checkboxes are unchecked. (ASSETS-26377) 

#### [!DNL Dynamic Media]{#assets-dm-6519}

* After an asset is uploaded to AEM, the `update_asset` workflow is triggered. The workflow never finishes. Looking at the workflow instances, the workflow finishes up to the product upload step. The next step is Scene7 batch upload. User can see that the asset is in Scene7 from the Dynamic Media Classic app. (ASSETS-30443) 
* A custom Servlet (API endpoint) is returning an incorrect Dynamic Media (Scene7) file name. It occurs when an asset is deleted and replaced with an asset of the same name. The custom servlet is returning the old Dynamic Media (Scene7) file name, while a "jcr" API call returns the correct file name. (ASSETS-29476) 
* Even after Sync is turned off at the Folder level, the Logs show the trigger of "Scene7 ReplicateOnModifyListener". The `ReplicateOnModifyListener/Worker` should skip processing on non-Dynamic Media folder assets and content fragments. (ASSETS-26705) 
* People with low vision are impacted if the Focus is not visible in drop-down elements (Content Only, View, More Options) in high contrast black and white modes. (ASSETS-25759) 
* People with low vision are impacted if luminosity contrast ratio for text on a page is less than 4.5:1. (ASSETS-25756) 
* Screen readers are not narrating the displayed pop-up message after submitting the data. (ASSETS-25755) 
* Screen readers are not recognizing landmarks in the page (Dynamic Media; creating a video encoding profile), when navigated using landmark/region shortcut key `D/R`. (ASSETS-25752) 
* Screen readers are not recognizing multiple landmarks in the page (Dynamic Media; creating interactive video), when navigated using landmark/region shortcut key `D/R`. (ASSETS-25750) 
* Screen readers (NVDA/JAWS/Narrator) are not recognizing the Landmarks in **Edit Asset** page while navigating using the shortcut keys `D/R`. (ASSETS-25744) 
* User gets an empty/false async job message but the connected asset is published successfully. (ASSETS-29342)

<!-- THESE KNOWN ISSUES CARRY OVER EACH RELEASE. THE "PRODUCT UPDATES TEAM" IS SUPPOSED TO VERIFY EACH ISSUE AND LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE ADDED, DELETED, OR CHANGED IN THIS LIST.-->

<!-- * **Page publishing not working in Page Editor after upgrading to Service Pack 18 (6.5.18.0)** -->

  <!-- https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SITES-15856 REMOVE FOR 6.5.19.0 --> 
  <!-- After you upgrade an instance of AEM 6.5.0.0&mdash;6.5.17.0 to AEM 6.5.19.0, when you click **Publish Page** inside the Page Editor, you are redirected to a URL that does not exist.

  To work around this issue, do one of the following:

  * Remove the following "path" property.

       `/libs/wcm/core/content/editor/jcr:content/content/items/content/header/items/headerbar/items/pageinfopopover/items/list/items/publish/granite:data`

  * Paste the correct URL directly into the browser.

       `http://localhost:4504/editor.html/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/publishpagewizard.html?item=/content/we-retail/language-masters/en/about-us.html` -->



* **Related to Oak**
  From Service Pack 13 and above, the following error log has begun to appear which affects the persistence cache:

  ```shell
  org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.0.202/5]
  at org.h2.mvstore.DataUtils.newMVStoreException(DataUtils.java:1004)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.getUnsupportedWriteFormatException(MVStore.java:1059)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.readStoreHeader(MVStore.java:878)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.<init>(MVStore.java:455)
      at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore$Builder.open(MVStore.java:4052)
      at org.h2.mvstore.db.Store.<init>(Store.java:129)
  ```

  Or

  ```shell
  org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.1.214/5].
  ```

  To resolve this exception, do the following:

    1. Delete the following two folders from `crx-quickstart/repository/`

        * `cache`
        * `diff-cache`

    1. Install the Service Pack, or restart Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. 
      New folders of `cache` and `diff-cache` are automatically created and you no longer experience an exception related to `mvstore` in the `error.log`.

* Update your GraphQL queries that may have used a custom API name for your content model to use the default name of the content model instead.

* A GraphQL query may use the `damAssetLucene` index instead of the `fragments` index. This action might result in GraphQL queries that fail, or take a long time to run.

  To correct the problem, `damAssetLucene` has to be configured to include the following two properties under `/indexRules/dam:Asset/properties`:

  * `contentFragment`
    * `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    * `name="jcr:content/contentFragment"`
    * `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    * `type="Boolean"`
  * `model`
    * `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    * `name="jcr:content/data/cq:model"`
    * `ordered="{Boolean}true"`
    * `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    * `type="String"`

  After the index definition is changed, a reindexing is required (`reindex` = `true`).

  After these steps, the GraphQL queries should perform faster.

* When trying to move, delete, or publish either Content Fragments, Sites, or Pages, there is an issue when Content Fragment references are fetched, as the background query fails. That is, the functionality does not work.
  To ensure correct operation, you must add the following properties to the index definition node `/oak:index/damAssetLucene` (no reindexing is required):

   ```xml
   "tags": [
       "visualSimilaritySearch"
     ]
   "refresh": true
   ```

* When executing a GraphQL query using optional variables, if a specific value is **not** provided for the optional variable, then the value for that variable will be considered an implicit `null`. This means that the filter will match only `null` values for the corresponding property.

  For example, in the query below, where no value is specified for the property `lastName`:

  ```graphql
  query getAuthorsFilteredByLastName($authorLastName: String) {
  authorList(filter:
    {
      lastName: {_expressions: {value: $authorLastName}
      }}) {
    items {
      lastName
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Only authors with the `lastName` property set to null will be returned:

  ```graphql
  {
  "data": {
    "authorList": {
      "items": [
        {
          "lastName": null
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  }
  ```

* If you upgrade your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance from 6.5.0 - 6.5.4 to the latest service pack on Java&trade; 11, you see `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. To stop the exceptions, restart your instance of [!DNL Experience Manager]. <!-- THIS BULLET POINT WAS UPDATED AS PER CQDOC-20021, JANUARY 23, 2023 --> 

* Users can rename a folder in a hierarchy in [!DNL Assets] and publish a nested folder to [!DNL Brand Portal]. However, the title of the folder is not updated in [!DNL Brand Portal] until the root folder is republished.

* The following errors and warning messages may be displayed during installation of [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.x.x:
  * "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in [!DNL Experience Manager] using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type "Experience Fragment"/source "Adobe Experience Manager," Target creates several offers with type "HTML"/source "Adobe Target Classic."
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler`: No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN are used (CQ-4274424).
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler` - No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * The hotspot in a Dynamic Media interactive image is not visible when previewing the asset through the Shoppable Banner viewer.
  * `com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider bundle com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider:1.3.5 (395)[com.adobe.cq.social.provider.jcr.impl.SpiSocialJcrResourceProviderImpl(2302)]` : Timeout waiting for register change to complete unregistered.

* Starting with AEM 6.5.15, the Rhino JavaScript Engine provided by the ```org.apache.servicemix.bundles.rhino``` bundle has a new hoisting behavior. Scripts that use the strict mode (```use strict;```) have to correctly declare their variables, otherwise they do not get run, instead throwing a runtime error.
 
### Known issues for AEM Forms

#### Supported platforms 

* JDK 11.0.20 is not supported to install AEM Forms on JEE Installer. Only JDK 11.0.19 or earlier versions are supported to install AEM Forms on JEE Installer. (FORMS-10659)

#### Installation 

* On JBoss&reg; 7.1.4 platform, when user installs Experience Manager 6.5.16.0 or later service pack, `adobe-livecycle-jboss.ear` deployment fails. (CQ-4351522, CQDOC-20159)

<!-- 
* After upgrading to AEM Forms 6.5.18.0 JBoss&reg; Turnkey full installer environment on Windows Server 2022, when compiling Output client application code using Java&trade; 11, the following compilation error may occur:
  
  ```
  error: error reading [AEM_Forms_Installation_dir]\sdk\client-libs\common\adobe-output-client.jar; java.net.URISyntaxException: 
  Illegal character in path at index 70: file:/[AEM_Forms_Installation_dir]/sdk/client-libs/common/${clover.jar.name} 1 error
  
  ```
  
  To resolve the issue, perform the following steps:
    1. Navigate to `[AEM_Forms_Installation_dir]\sdk\client-libs\common\` and unzip `adobe-output-client.jar` to extract the `Manifest.mf` file.
    1. Update the `Manifest.mf` file by removing the entry `${clover.jar.name}` from the class-path attribute. 

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        > You can also use an in-place editing tool, for example, 7-zip, to update the `Manifest.mf` file.  

    1. Save the updated the `Manifest.mf` in the `adobe-output-client.jar` archive. 
    1. Save the modified `adobe-output-client.jar` file and rerun the setup. (CQDOC-20878) -->

<!--* After installing AEM Service Pack 6.5.19.0 full installer, the EAR deployment fails on JEE using JBoss&reg; Turnkey. 
To resolve the issue, locate the `<AEM_Forms_Installation_dir>\jboss\bin\standalone.bat` file and update `Adobe_Adobe_JAVA_HOME` to `Adobe_JAVA_HOME` for all occurrences before running the configuration manager. (CQDOC-20803)-->

#### Install the servlet fragment (AEM Service Pack 6.5.14.0 or earlier)

* If you are upgrading to AEM Service Pack 6.5.15.0 or higher, and your AEM instance is operating on Tomcat 8.5.88, it is mandatory that you install the servlet fragment *before* you proceed with the installation of Service Pack 6.5.15.0 or higher.
* It is mandatory that you install the servlet fragment for all application servers except those running on JBoss&reg; EAP 7.4.0.

**To install the servlet fragment:**

1. Download the servlet fragment from [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/featurepack/org.apache.felix.http.servlet-api-1.2.0_fragment_full.jar).
1. Start the application server. 
1. Wait for the logs to stabilize and check the bundle state.
1. Open Web Console Bundles. The default URL is `http://[Server]:[Port]/system/console/bundles`.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Install]** or **[!UICONTROL Update]**. 
1. Select the downloaded fragment 
`org.apache.felix.http.servlet-api-1.2.0_fragment_full.jar` 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Install]** or **[!UICONTROL Update]**. 
1. Wait for the application server to stabilize.
1. Stop the application server.

#### Adaptive Forms

* When an Adaptive Form is published, all its dependencies, including policies, get republished, even if no modifications have been made to them. (FORMS-10454)
* When a user selects to configure a field for the first time in an adaptive form, the option to save a configuration does not display in Properties Browser. Selecting to configure some other field of the Adaptive Form in the same editor resolves the issue. 
* When users perform the submit action, the submission fails with an error: 
`javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`
To resolve the issue, [recompile the Sling scripts such as JSP, Java&trade;, and Sightly](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-16543.html#resolution). (FORMS-8542)
* After installing AEM Service Pack 6.5.14.0 and onwards, users are unable to select a font from the JEE Admin UI for PDF documents when navigating to `Home` > `Services` > `PDF Generator` > `Adobe PDF Settings`, as the font list appears empty. (FORMS-12095)
* Adaptive Forms let you use custom functions with ECMAScript version 5 or earlier. When a custom function uses ECMAScript version 6 or later, like 'let', 'const', or arrow functions, the rule editor might not open properly.
* When you submit an adaptive form, the checkbox stores the wrong value. It adds an extra "/" for each ",". (FORMS-12093)
* When you submit an Adaptive Form based on Core Components, the form fails to submit. Apply the feature toggle - ft-cq-4324864 to fix the issue. To apply a feature toggle:  
  1. Open the URL: `http://[server]:[port]/system/console/configMgr`
  1. Search and open the `com.adobe.granite.toggle.impl.dev.DynamicToggleProviderImpl` configuration 
  1. Specify the feature toogle number. For example, ft-cq-4324864.
  1. Save the configuration. The feature is now enabled. (FORMS-12789)
* In an Adaptive Form based on an XDP with embedded scripts on checkboxes, the scripts are not executed for elements after such checkboxes. (FORMS-14244)
* Rows in the date picker widget are truncated when traversing through months in the pop-up widget for fields with Edit/Display pattern. (FORMS-13620)
* When an Adaptive Form is submitted from an Adobe Experience Manager Publish instance to an Adobe Experience Manager Workflow, the workflow fails to save the attachments. (FORMS-14209)


#### AEM Forms on JEE 

* Critical security vulnerabilities have been reported for Struts 2 RCE, a popular and open-source web application framework for developing Java EE web applications. Adobe has released [AEM 6.5 Service Pack 19.1 (6.5.19.1)](/help/forms/using/mitigating-struts-2-rce-vulnerabilities-for-experience-manager-manager-form.md) to address the vulnerability in AEM Forms on JEE. 

* The PDF Generator service fails to enumerate the fonts available on the server. Consequently, the font selection panel on the Adobe PDF Settings page in the PDFG Admin UI remains empty, effectively preventing (un)embedding of chosen fonts. (FORMS-12095)

#### Interactive Communications

* The prefill service fails with a null pointer exception. (CQDOC-21355)
* In the Print Preview of the Interactive Communications Agent UI, the currency symbol (such as the dollar sign $) is inconsistently displayed for all field values. It appears for values up to 999 but is missing for values of 1000 and above. (FORMS-16557)
* Any modifications to nested layout fragments' XDP in an Interactive Communication are not reflected in the IC editor. (FORMS-16575)
* In the Print Preview of the Interactive Communications Agent UI, some calculated values are not displayed correctly. (FORMS-16603)
* When the letter is viewed in Print Preview, the content changes. Some spaces disappear, and certain letters are replaced with ‘x’. (FORMS-15681)

<!--The font enumeration fails due to the missing Ps2Pdf service file.-->
