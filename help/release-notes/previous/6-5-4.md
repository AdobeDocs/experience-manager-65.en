### Configure [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] with [!DNL Brand Portal] (6.5.4.0) {#configure-assets-bp}

The authorization channel between [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] and [!DNL Brand Portal] is changed. Earlier, [!DNL Brand Portal] was configured in Classic UI via Legacy OAuth Gateway, which uses the JWT token exchange to obtain an IMS Access token for authorization. [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] is now configured with [!DNL Brand Portal] through [!DNL Adobe I/O], which procures an IMS token for authorization of your [!DNL Brand Portal] tenant.

The steps to configure [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] with [!DNL Brand Portal] are different depending on your [!DNL Experience Manager] version, and whether you are configuring for the first time, or upgrading the existing configurations. See [Configure Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-brand-portal/using/publish/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html) for details.

## UberJar {#uber-jar}

The UberJar for Experience Manager 6.5.4.0 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.5.4/).

To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md) and include the following dependency in your project POM:

```shell
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
     <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
     <version>6.5.4</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.maven.apache.org`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.
