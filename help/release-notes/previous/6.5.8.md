# [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.8.0 {#experience-manager-6580}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.8.0 includes new features, key customer-requested enhancements, and performance, stability, and security improvements, that are released since the availability of 6.5 release in April 2019. The service pack is installed on [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.

The key features and enhancements introduced in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.8.0 are:

<!-- TBD:
* Using the Connected Assets functionality, it is now possible to connect up to 3 [!DNL Sites] instances with 1 [!DNL Assets] instances. The configuration user interface now allows the administrators to provide the details of these [!DNL Sites] instances. -->

* When using [Connected Assets functionality](/help/assets/use-assets-across-connected-assets-instances.md), you can now view a list of all the [!DNL Sites] pages that use the asset. These references to an asset are available in an asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page. This allows administrators, marketers, and librarians a complete view of assets usage, allowing for better tracking, management, and brand consistency.

* When deleting an asset that is referenced in a web page, [!DNL Experience Manager] [displays a warning](/help/assets/use-assets-across-connected-assets-instances.md#asset-usage-references). You can force delete a referenced asset or check and modify the references that are displayed in the [!DNL Properties] page of the asset. Clicking the references opens the local and remote [!DNL Sites] pages.

* Sorting the Live Copy pages available for rollout using the [!UICONTROL Name], [!UICONTROL Last modified date,] and [!UICONTROL Last rollout date] properties.

* The built-in repository (Apache Jackrabbit Oak) is updated to 1.22.6. <!-- TBD: Mention the version -->

The following is the list of fixes provided in [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5.8.0 release.

## [!DNL Sites] {#sites-6580}

* When a page is moved to blueprint, the destination of links is not updated (NPR-35724).
* Tizen based player fails to authenticate on certain browsers. The issue occurs with browsers that do not support the samesite=none attribute (NPR-35589).
* An unlocked responsive container does not display allowed components (NPR-35565).
* When you create a live copy of a newly added page, the language master creates two copies for each domain (NPR-35545).
* Deadlock in the SCR Component Registry when many threads are blocked due to `org.apache.felix.scr.impl.ComponentRegistry` timer. As a result, [!DNL Experience Manager] stops responding for an indefinite time (GRANITE-33125,FELIX-6252).
* When you search a specific asset in the side rail, the result contains some not-searched assets (NPR-35524).
* When you enable SSL for an Experience Manager instance, the context path is removed (NPR-35477).
* When you create a list, add some text as the first element, add a table as the second element, and add a list inside the table, the parent list distorts (NPR-35465).
* When you use different plugins on consecutive list items, an extra <br> tag is added to the list items (NPR-35464).
* When a list is placed between two paragraphs, you cannot add a table to the list (NPR-35356).
* When you start an AEM instance upgrade from AEM 6.3 to AEM 6.5, the upgrade instance takes longer to start (NPR-35323).
* When you replicate an AEM asset that includes a bracket (). in the name, the replication fails (GRANITE-27004, NPR-35315).
* When you add headings to a Rich Text Editor, the paragraph button is disabled (NPR-35256).
* When you add an item to an existing list, it deletes the succeeding collapsible or toggle list (NPR-35206).
* When the Rollout page option is selected, a dialog box with all the available live copies appears, and automatic rollout takes place. The live copies of pages are rolled out to all geographies without user action (NPR-35138).
* When you use the include children option, the Manage Publication option does not list all pages. Only 22 pages are listed (NPR-35086). 
* When a policy is edited, the text component does not retain the policy changes (NPR-35070).
* When indenting some items in a numbered list, all items keep the same number although numbering should start from 1 for items with the same indentation (CQ-4313011).
* When minification is enabled, you are not able to edit any page or component. The issues started after installing AEM 6.5 Service Pack 7 (CQ-4311133).
* Omni search and asset filters return irrelevant or no results (CQ-4312322, NPR-35793).
* When multiple pages simultaneously access a client library, the HTML library manager fails to load the client library. It leads to the incorrect rendering of pages (NPR-35538).
* The context path gets removed automatically when you set up an SSL in [!DNL Experience Manager] (NPR-35294).
* Package manager does not log out users after clicking the Logout option (NPR-35160).

## [!DNL Assets] {#assets-6580}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5.8.0 [!DNL Assets] fixes the following issues and provides the following enhancements.

* Upon restoring a previous version of an asset, the event DamEvent.Type RESTORED is not triggered in the OSGi console (NPR-35789).

* An error message is displayed when trying to save an [!UICONTROL Asset Contribution] type folder with multibyte characters in the name (NPR-35605).
* When cascading metadata subtype fields are used, an incorrect 'Please fill out this field' error occurs (NPR-35643).
* When an existing asset is dragged on the [!DNL Assets] user interface and a new version is created, the changes in the metadata are not persistent (NPR-34940).
* When creating rules in metadata schema editor for a cascading menu, the [!UICONTROL Dependant On] option repeats the same name (NPR-35596).
* Similarity search does not work after editing [!UICONTROL Assets Admin Search Rail] (NPR-35588).

* Users are not able to rearrange or sort assets in list view in an orderable folder (NPR-35516).
* If you edit the default metadata schema, the tags field in asset's [!UICONTROL Properties] page changes into a text field. The change allows unaware users to add on-demand tags and the tags are stored as a string in the repository (NPR-35478).
* When downloading an asset, if you provide a name that does not have a valid email address, the download option is unavailable. However, if another option in the download dialog is selected, the button is enabled, but an email is not sent (NPR-35365).
* Users are unable to check-in assets after editing those in [!DNL Adobe InDesign] and receive error about lack of permissions (NPR-35341).

* When a new version of an existing asset is created after resolving the naming conflict, the metadata of original asset is overwritten (CQ-4313594).
* When you filter asset search using a search filter or predicate, open an asset to view or edit it, and go back to the search results page, the filter does not work. All the searched assets are listed unfiltered (NPR-35913).

### [!DNL Dynamic Media] {#dynamic-media-6580}

* The URL option for RESS image preset is enabled on the asset details page. Now, both URL and RESS options are available on the asset details page when RESS image preset is selected in the dynamic renditions section. (CQ-4311241)
* Interactive media component - interactive video does not work if the user has [!DNL Experience Manager] with selective publish configuration (CQ-4311054).

* If an asset is published on [!DNL Experience Manager] and is set to publish to [!DNL Dynamic Media] on activation, the `scene7FileStatus` metadata value does not update as expected (CQ-4308269).
* When editing the video profile, [!DNL Experience Manager] does not display the height and bitrate values set for the video preset. The fields appear blank (CQ-4311828).

## [!DNL Commerce] {#commerce-6580}

* Unable to create a custom tag for all products in Commerce (CQ-4310682).

* Product asset reference update causes replication threads to be in the wait state until the ProductAssetListener thread completes its commits to the JCR (NPR-35269).

## Platform {#platform-6580}

* When you use a Coral Tab View component with no tabs and then trigger a Foundation validator, the following error occurs (NPR-35636):

  ```TXT
   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'invalid' of undefined

    at foundation.js:10710
  ```

* SCD forward replication fails for Delete events for nodes that include a comma in the name (NPR-35191).

* Broken access control and denial of service with `DSRPReindexServlet` which brings the communities site down until the indexing is complete (NPR-35591).

* You may notice some performance impact and slowness, when attempting to add tags to a new blog by selecting **[!UICONTROL Add Tags]**. To improve performance, install [cqTagLucene-0.0.1.zip hotfix](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/hotfix/cqTagLucene-0.0.1.zip).

## UberJar {#uber-jar}

The UberJar for Experience Manager 6.5.8.0 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.5.8/).

To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/help/sites-developing/ht-projects-maven.md) and include the following dependency in your project POM:

```shell
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
     <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
     <version>6.5.8</version>
     <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.maven.apache.org`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.

## Known issues in Experience Manager 6.5.8.0 {#known-issues-6580}

<!-- REMOVED AS PER CQDOC-20022, JANUARY 23, 2023 * If you install [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5 Service Pack 10 or a previous service pack on [!DNL Experience Manager] 6.5, the runtime copy of your assets custom workflow model (created in `/var/workflow/models/dam`) is deleted.
To retrieve your runtime copy, Adobe recommends to synchronize the design-time copy of the custom workflow model with its runtime copy using the HTTP API:
`<designModelPath>/jcr:content.generate.json`. -->

* If you are upgrading your [!DNL Experience Manager] instance from 6.5 to 6.5.8.0 version, you can view `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. Restart the instance to resolve the issue.
* Contact Adobe Customer Support if you encounter issues when editing and creating cascading rules in [!UICONTROL Folder Metadata Schema Forms Editor] and [!UICONTROL Metadata Schema Forms Editor] using [!UICONTROL Define Rule] dialog. The rules that are already created and saved are working as expected.

* If a folder in the hierarchy is renamed in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] and the nested folder containing an asset is published to [!DNL Brand Portal], the title of the folder is not updated in [!DNL Brand Portal] until the root folder is published again.

* When a user selects to configure a field for the first time in an adaptive form, the option to save a configuration does not display in Properties Browser. Selecting to configure some other field of the adaptive form in the same editor resolves the issue.

* If [!UICONTROL Connected assets configuration] wizard returns a 404 error message after installation, manually reinstall the `cq-remotedam-client-ui-content` and `cq-remotedam-client-ui-components` packages using the Package Manager.

* The following errors and warning messages may display during installation of Experience Manager 6.5.x.x:
  * "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in Experience Manager using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type "Experience Fragment"/source "Adobe Experience Manager," Target creates several offers with type "HTML"/source "Adobe Target Classic."
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler`: No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Adaptive Form server-side validation fails when aggregate functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN are used (CQ-4274424).
  * `com.adobe.granite.maintenance.impl.TaskScheduler` - No maintenance windows found at granite/operations/maintenance.
  * Hotspot in a Dynamic Media interactive image is not visible when previewing the asset through Shoppable Banner viewer.
  * `com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider bundle com.adobe.cq.social.cq-social-jcr-provider:1.3.5 (395)[com.adobe.cq.social.provider.jcr.impl.SpiSocialJcrResourceProviderImpl(2302)]` : Timeout waiting for reg change to complete unregistered.
