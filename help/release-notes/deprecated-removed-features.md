# Deprecated and Removed Features{#deprecated-and-removed-features}

Adobe constantly evaluates product capabilities, to over time reinvent or replace older features with more modern alternatives to improve overall customer value, always under careful consideration of backward compatibility.

To communicate the impending removal/replacement of AEM capabilities, the following rules apply:

1. Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated, capabiiities are still available, but they will not be further enhanced.
1. Removal of deprecated capabilities will occur in the following major release at the earliest. Actual target date for removal will be announced.

This process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal.

## Deprecated Features {#deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with AEM 6.5. Generally, features that are planned to be removed in a future release are set to deprecated first, with an alternative provided.

Customers are advised to review if they make use of the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.
