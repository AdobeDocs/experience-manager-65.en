# Deprecated and removed features {#deprecated-and-removed-features}

Adobe constantly evaluates product capabilities, to over time reinvent or replace older features with more modern alternatives to improve overall customer value, always under careful consideration of backward compatibility.

To communicate the impending removal or replacement of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) capabilities, the following rules apply:

1. Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated, capabilities are still available but are not further enhanced.
1. Removal of deprecated capabilities occurs in the following major release at the earliest. Actual target date for removal will be announced.

This process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal.

## Deprecated features {#deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with AEM 6.5. Generally, features that are planned to be removed in a future release are set to deprecated first, with an alternative provided.

Customers are advised to review if they use the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.

|Area|Feature|Replacement|Version (SP)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Screens | ActiveMQ in AEM. |  |  |
| [!DNL Sites] | Experience Fragments properties for **Social Media Status**. |   | 6.5.11.0 |
| [!DNL Sites] | Content fragment templates, for creating simple content fragments. | [Model-based structured content fragments](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-models.md) now. |6.5.11.0|
|Creative Cloud integration|AEM to Creative Cloud Folder Sharing was introduced in AEM 6.2 as a way to give creative users access to assets from AEM, so that they could open them in [!DNL Creative Cloud] applications and upload new files or save changes to AEM. A new capability released in Creative Cloud application, Adobe Asset Link, provides a much better user experience and more powerful access to assets from AEM directly from inside Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to the AEM to Creative Cloud Folder Sharing integration. While the feature is included in AEM, customers are advised to use replacement solutions.|Customers are advised to switch to new Creative Cloud integration capabilities, including Adobe Asset Link or AEM desktop app. ||
| Assets |`AssetDownloadServlet` is disabled by default for the publish instances. For more details, see [AEM security checklist](/help/sites-administering/security-checklist.md). | Configuration described at [AEM Security checklist](/help/sites-administering/security-checklist.md). ||
<!-- Search&Promote is end-of-life September 1, 2022 | Assets | If a user does not have sufficient (read and write) permissions on `/content/dam/collections`, the user cannot create a Collection. | Honor the access control setup of user and ensure appropriate permissions. ||
|Adobe Search & Promote|The integration with Adobe Search & Promote is deprecated. Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to the Search & Promote integration. Adobe Search & Promote integration remains fully supported while being deprecated.||| -->
| DTM Tag Manager | The integration with DTM (Dynamic Tag Manager) is deprecated. | Switch to use Adobe Experience Platform Launch as a tag manager. ||
|Adobe Target|With adding the ability for AEM to connect to Adobe Target service using the [!DNL Adobe I/O] based Adobe Target Standard API (Rest API) in AEM 6.5, the Target Classic API (XML) way is deprecated.|Reconfigure the integration to [use the new API](/help/sites-administering/target.md). ||
|Adobe Target|Using the `mbox.js` based integration with Adobe Target in AEM is deprecated.|Switch to use `at.js` 1.x.||
| Commerce | [CIF REST](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-api) was provided in 2018 as a set of microservices to enable integrations between AEM and commerce engines. After Adobe acquired Magento in mid 2018, Adobe decided to change its approach for two reasons. Magento has its own set of Commerce APIs (REST and GraphQL) and it's not good practice to maintain two sets of APIs. Market trends indicated that customers were moving towards GraphQL, because it's a more efficient way of querying data. In 2019, Adobe has released the new Commerce Integration Framework using Magento's GraphQL APIs as the source of truth. Adobe doesn't plan to make any further investment in CIF REST. Customers are advised to use the replacement solution.|For AEM-Magento integrations, switch to [AEM CIF Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-project-archetype) and [AEM CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components). See AEM and Adobe Commerce integration [using Commerce Integration Framework](/help/commerce/cif/integrating/magento.md). Support for third party (other than Magento) integrations with the new approach is on our roadmap.||
| Components (AEM Sites) | Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to most of the Foundation Components stored in `/libs/foundation/components`. Look for the `cq:deprecated` and `cq:deprecatedReason` property in the component folder. AEM 6.5 has the Foundation Components included, and customers upgrading from earlier releases can keep using them as is. Further, the Foundation Components is supported even though deprecated. | Adobe recommends using the Core Components for future projects. Existing sites can remain as is or use the [AEM Modernize Tools Suite](https://github.com/adobe/aem-modernize-tools) to refactor the site to use Core Components. ||
|Components (AEM Sites)|Design Importer Components `/libs/wcm/designimporter/components` have been marked as deprecated starting 6.5.

Up until AEM 6.4, YUI was default to minify JavaScript with the option to switch to Google Closure Compiler (GCC).
