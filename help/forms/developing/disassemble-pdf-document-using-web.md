# Disassemble a PDF document using the web service API {#disassemble-a-pdf-document-usingthe-web-service-api} 

**Samples and examples in this document are only for AEM Forms on JEE environment.**

Disassemble a PDF document by using the Assembler Service API (web service):

1. Include project files.

   Create a Microsoft .NET project that uses MTOM. Ensure that you use the following WSDL definition when setting a service reference: `http://localhost:8080/soap/services/AssemblerService?WSDL&lc_version=9.0.1`.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Replace `localhost` with the IP address of the server hosting AEM Forms.

1. Create a PDF Assembler client.

    * Create an `AssemblerServiceClient` object by using its default constructor.
    * Create an `AssemblerServiceClient.Endpoint.Address` object by using the `System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress` constructor. Pass a string value that specifies the WSDL to the AEM Forms service (for example, `http://localhost:8080/soap/services/AssemblerService?blob=mtom`). You do not need to use the `lc_version` attribute. This attribute is used when you create a service reference.
    * Create a `System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding` object by getting the value of the `AssemblerServiceClient.Endpoint.Binding` field. Cast the return value to `BasicHttpBinding`.
    * Set the `System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding` object’s `MessageEncoding` field to `WSMessageEncoding.Mtom`. This value ensures that MTOM is used.
    * Enable basic HTTP authentication by performing the following tasks:

        * Assign the AEM forms user name to the field `AssemblerServiceClient.ClientCredentials.UserName.UserName`.
        * Assign the corresponding password value to the field `AssemblerServiceClient.ClientCredentials.UserName.Password`.
        * Assign the constant value `HttpClientCredentialType.Basic` to the field `BasicHttpBindingSecurity.Transport.ClientCredentialType`.
        * Assign the constant value `BasicHttpSecurityMode.TransportCredentialOnly` to the field `BasicHttpBindingSecurity.Security.Mode`.

1. Reference an existing DDX document.

    * Create a `BLOB` object by using its constructor. The `BLOB` object is used to store the DDX document.
    * Create a `System.IO.FileStream` object by invoking its constructor. Pass a string value that represents the file location of the DDX document and the mode in which to open the file.
    * Create a byte array that stores the content of the `System.IO.FileStream` object. You can determine the size of the byte array by getting the `System.IO.FileStream` object’s `Length` property.
    * Populate the byte array with stream data by invoking the `System.IO.FileStream` object’s `Read` method and passing the byte array, the starting position, and the stream length to read.
    * Populate the `BLOB` object by assigning its `MTOM` property with the contents of the byte array.

1. Reference a PDF document to disassemble.

    * Create a `BLOB` object by using its constructor. The `BLOB` object is used to store the input PDF document. This `BLOB` object is passed to the `invokeOneDocument` as an argument.
    * Create a `System.IO.FileStream` object by invoking its constructor and passing a string value that represents the file location of the input PDF document and the mode in which to open the file.
    * Create a byte array that stores the content of the `System.IO.FileStream` object. You can determine the size of the byte array by getting the `System.IO.FileStream` object’s `Length` property.
    * Populate the byte array with stream data by invoking the `System.IO.FileStream` object’s `Read` method and passing the byte array, the starting position, and the stream length to read.
    * Populate the `BLOB` object by assigning its `MTOM` field the contents of the byte array.
    * Create a `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType` object. This collection object is used to store the PDF to disassemble.
    * Create a `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType_Item` object.
    * Assign a string value that represents the key name to the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType_Item` object’s `key` field. This value must match the value of the PDF source element specified in the DDX document.
    * Assign the `BLOB` object that stores the PDF document to the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType_Item` object’s `value` field.
    * Add the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType_Item` object to the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType` object. Invoke the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType` object’ `Add` method and pass the `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType` object.

1. Set run-time options.

    * Create an `AssemblerOptionSpec` object that stores run-time options by using its constructor.
    * Set run-time options to meet your business requirements by assigning a value to a data member that belongs to the `AssemblerOptionSpec` object. For example, to instruct the Assembler service to continue processing a job when an error occurs, assign `false` to the `AssemblerOptionSpec` object’s `failOnError` field.

1. Disassemble the PDF document.

   Invoke the `AssemblerServiceClient` object’s `invokeDDX` method and pass the following values:

    * A `BLOB` object that represents the DDX document that disassembles the PDF document
    * The `MyMapOf_xsd_string_To_xsd_anyType` object that contains the PDF document to disassemble
    * An `AssemblerOptionSpec` object that specifies run-time options

   The `invokeDDX` method returns an `AssemblerResult` object that contains the job results and any exceptions that occurred.

1. Save the disassembled PDF documents.

   To obtain the newly created PDF documents, perform the following actions:

    * Access the `AssemblerResult` object’s `documents` field, which is a `Map` object that contains the disassembled PDF documents.
    * Iterate through the `Map` object to obtain each resultant document. Then, cast that array member’s `value` to a `BLOB`.
    * Extract the binary data that represents the PDF document by accessing its `BLOB` object’s `MTOM` property. This returns an array of bytes that you can write out to a PDF file.
