# Credential Service Java&trade; API Quick Start (SOAP) {#credential-service-java-api-quickstart-soap}

Java&trade; API Quick Start(SOAP) is available for the Credential service.

[Quick Start (SOAP mode): Importing credentials using the Java&trade; API](credential-service-java-api-quick.md#quick-start-soap-mode-importing-credentials-using-the-java-api)

[Quick Start (SOAP mode): Deleting credentials using the Java&trade; API](credential-service-java-api-quick.md#quick-start-soap-mode-deleting-credentials-using-the-java-api)

AEM Forms operations can be performed using the AEM Forms strongly typed API and the connection mode should be set to SOAP.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Quick Starts in Programming with AEM forms are based on the Forms Server being deployed on JBoss&reg; and the Windows operating system. However, if you are using another operating system, such as UNIX&reg;, replace Windows-specific paths with paths supported by the applicable operating system. Likewise, if you are using another J2EE application server, then ensure that you specify valid connection properties. See [Setting connection properties](/help/forms/developing/invoking-aem-forms-using-java.md#setting-connection-properties).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot perform Credential service operations using web services.

## Quick Start (SOAP mode): Importing credentials using the Java&trade; API {#quick-start-soap-mode-importing-credentials-using-the-java-api}

The following code example imports a credential based on a file named *cred.p12*. The alias value used to import the credential is `Secure`. (See [Importing Credentials by using the Trust Manager API](/help/forms/developing/credentials.md#importing-credentials-by-using-the-trust-manager-api).)

```java
 /*
     * This Java Quick Start uses the SOAP mode and contains the following JAR files
     * in the class path:
     * 1. adobe-truststore-client.jar
     * 2. adobe-livecycle-client.jar
     * 3. adobe-usermanager-client.jar
     * 4. adobe-utilities.jar
     * 5. jboss-client.jar (use a different JAR file if the Forms Server is not deployed
     * on JBoss)
     * 6. activation.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 7. axis.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 8. commons-codec-1.3.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 9.  commons-collections-3.1.jar  (required for SOAP mode)
     * 10. commons-discovery.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 11. commons-logging.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 12. dom3-xml-apis-2.5.0.jar (required for SOAP mode)

     * 20. xbean.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 21. xercesImpl.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     *
     * These JAR files are in the following path:

     *
     * The jboss-client.jar file is in the following path:

     *
     * SOAP required JAR files are in the following path:
     * <install directory>/sdk/client-libs/thirdparty
     *
     * If you want to invoke a remote Forms Server instance and there is a
     * firewall between the client application and the server, then it is
     * recommended that you use the SOAP mode. When using the SOAP mode,
     * you have to include these additional JAR files
     *
     * For information about the SOAP
     * mode, see "Setting connection properties" in Programming
     * with AEM Forms
