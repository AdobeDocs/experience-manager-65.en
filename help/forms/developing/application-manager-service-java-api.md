# Application Manager Service JavaAPI Quick Start (SOAP) {#application-manager-service-javaapi-quick-start-soap}

Java API Quick Start(SOAP) is available for the Application Manager service.

[Quick Start: Deploying applications using the Java API(SOAP)](application-manager-service-java-api.md#quick-start-soap-mode-deploying-applications-using-the-java-api)

[Quick Start: Removing an application using the Java API(SOAP)](application-manager-service-java-api.md#quick-start-soap-mode-removing-an-application-using-the-java-api)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The application manager APIs support only AEM Forms LCA files. It does not support LCA files of LiveCycle ES2 and ES4.

AEM Forms operations can be performed using the AEM Forms strongly typed API and the connection mode should be set to SOAP.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Java API(SOAP) Quick Start in Programming with AEM forms are based on the Forms if you are using another operating system, such as Unix, replace windows specific paths with paths supported by the applicable operating system. Likewise, if you are using another J2EE application server, then ensure that you specify valid connection properties. See [Setting connection properties](/help/forms/developing/invoking-aem-forms-using-java.md#setting-connection-properties).

## Quick Start (SOAP mode): Deploying Applications using the Java API {#quick-start-soap-mode-deploying-applications-using-the-java-api}

The following Java code example imports an application based on an existing LCA file named *EncryptDocument.lca*.

```java
 /*
     * This Java Quick Start uses the SOAP mode and contains the following JAR files
     * in the class path:
     * 1. adobe-livecycle-client.jar
     * 2. adobe-usermanager-client.jar
     * 3. activation.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 4. axis.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 5. commons-codec-1.3.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 6. commons-collections-3.2.jar  (required for SOAP mode)
     * 7. commons-discovery.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 8. commons-logging.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 9. dom3-xml-apis-2.5.0.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 10. jaxen-1.1-beta-9.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 11. jaxrpc.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 12. log4j.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 13. mail.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 14. saaj.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 15. wsdl4j.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 16. xalan.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 17. xbean.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 18. xercesImpl.jar (required for SOAP mode)
     * 19. adobe-workflow-client-sdk.jar
     * 20. adobe-applicationmanager-client-sdk.jar
 
     * The JBoss files must be kept in the jboss\client folder. You can copy the client folder to
     * your local development environment and then include the 3 JBoss JAR files in your class path
     *
     * These JAR files are in the following path:
     * <install directory>/sdk/client-libs/common
     *
     *
     * <install directory>/jboss/bin/client
     *
     * If you want to invoke a remote Forms Server instance and there is a
     * firewall between the client application and the server, then it is
     * recommended that you use the SOAP mode. When using the SOAP mode,
     * you have to include additional JAR files in the following
     * path
     * <install directory>/sdk/client-libs/thirdparty
     *
     * For information about the SOAP
     * mode and the additional JAR files that need to be included,
     * see "Setting connection properties" in Programming
     * with AEM Forms
