# Working with PDF Utilities {#working-with-pdf-utilities} 

**Samples and examples in this document are only for AEM Forms on JEE environment.**

**About the PDF Utilities Service**

The PDF Utilities service can convert between PDF and XDP file formats, set and retrieve PDF document properties, and manipulate XMP metadata. For example, before converting a PDF document to another format, it is useful to inspect its properties to determine which service operation to invoke for the conversion.

You can accomplish these tasks using the PDF Utilities service:

* Convert PDF documents to XDP documents.
* Convert XDP documents to PDF documents. (See [Converting XDP Documents into PDF Documents](pdf-utilities.md#converting-xdp-documents-into-pdf-documents).)
* Retrieve PDF document properties. (See [Retrieving PDF Document Properties](pdf-utilities.md#retrieving-pdf-document-properties).)
* Save a PDF document and optimize it for fast web viewing. (See [Setting PDF Document Save Modes](pdf-utilities.md#setting-pdf-document-save-modes).)

## Converting PDF Documents into XDP Documents {#converting-pdf-documents-into-xdp-documents}

You can use the PDF Utilities Java and web service APIs to programmatically convert PDF documents into XDP documents.

### Summary of steps {#summary-of-steps}

To convert a PDF document into an XDP document, perform the following steps:

1. Include project files.
1. Create a PDFUtilityService client.
1. Invoke the PDF to XDP conversion operation.

**Include project files**

Include necessary files into your development project. If you are creating a client application using Java, include the necessary JAR files. If you are using web services, ensure that you include the proxy files.

**Create a PDFUtilityService client**

Before you can programmatically perform a PDF Utilities operation, you must create a PDFUtilityService client. With the Java API, this is accomplished by creating a `PDFUtilityServiceClient` object. With the web service API, this is accomplished by using a `PDFUtilityServiceService` object.

**Invoke the PDF to XDP conversion operation**

After you create the service client, you can invoke the PDF to XDP conversion operation.

## Setting PDF Document Save Modes {#setting-pdf-document-save-modes}

You can use the PDF Utilities service Java and web service APIs to programmatically set a save mode for a PDF document. When using the PDF Utilities service to set a save mode, the PDF Utilities service only sets the save mode and does not actually save the PDF document. The PDF document is saved when it is passed to another service operation. For example, you can use the PDF Utilities service to set a specific save mode and pass it to the Encryption service, where the PDF document is actually saved and encrypted.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information about the PDF Utilities service, see [Services Reference for AEM Forms](https://www.adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_services_63).

### Summary of steps {#summary_of_steps-3}

To set the save option for PDF documents, perform the following steps:

1. Include project files.
1. Create a PDFUtilityService client.
1. Set the save mode.
1. Invoke the save operation.
1. Pass the PDF document to another operation.

**Include project files**

Include necessary files into your development project. If you are creating a client application using Java, include the necessary JAR files. If you are using web services, ensure that you include the proxy files.

**Create a PDFUtilityService client**

Before you can programmatically perform a PDF Utilities operation, you must create a PDFUtilityService client. With the Java API, this is accomplished by creating a `PDFUtilityServiceClient` object. With the web service API, this is accomplished using a `PDFUtilityServiceService` object.

**Set the Save mode**

You can choose one of the following save options:

* `INCREMENTAL`: To save incrementally to reduce the time required to save
* `FAST_WEB_VIEW`: save for fast web viewing
* `FULL`: To save using a full save (without optimizations)

**Invoke the save style operation**

After you create the service client, you can invoke the properties retrieval operation.

**Pass the PDF document to another AEM Forms operation**

Once the PDF Utilities service sets the specified Save mode, pass the PDF document to another AEM Forms operation. Once returned from that operation, the PDF document is saved in the specified mode. For example, if you use the PDF Utilities service to set the `FAST_WEB_VIEW` mode and then pass the PDF document to the Encryption service’s `encryptUsingPassword` operation, the returned PDF document is encrypted with a password and save in the `FAST_WEB_VIEW` mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Quick Start that is associated with this section sets the `FAST_WEB_VIEW` mode and then passes the PDF document to the Encryption service’s `encryptUsingPassword` operation.

   Create a `PDFUtilityServiceClient` object by using its constructor and passing a `ServiceClientFactory` object that contains connection properties.

1. Set the Save mode

    * Create a `PDFUtilitySaveMode` object by using its constructor.
    * Set the save mode by invoking the `PDFUtilitySaveMode` object’s `setSaveStyle` method and passing a string value that specifies the save mode. For example, to save for fast web viewing, pass `FAST_WEB_VIEW`.

1. Invoke the save style operation

   Invoke the `PDFUtilityServiceClient` object’s `setSaveMode` method and pass the following values:

    * A `com.adobe.idp.Document` object that represents the PDF document.
    * A `PDFUtilitySaveMode` object that contains the save style to be used.
