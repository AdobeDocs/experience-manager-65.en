### New Features

#### New Adaptive Form Core Components

Vertical tabs, Terms & Conditions, and Checkbox are added to enhance the scalability of forms.

* **[Checkbox component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/checkbox.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a checkbox component. It allows users to make binary choices, selecting or deselecting a particular option. It typically appears as a small box that can be clicked or tapped to toggle between two states: checked and unchecked. The checkbox is a common form element used to present a yes/no or true/false choice.

* **[Terms and Conditions component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/adaptive-forms-components/terms-and-conditions.html)**: Adaptive Forms based on Core Components can now include a Terms and Conditions component. It allows forms authors to introduce a specific section within the form where users are presented with the terms, conditions, or legal agreements associated with the use of a service, product, or platform. This component is designed to inform users about the rules, regulations, and obligations they are agreeing to by submitting the form.

## Adaptive Forms {#adaptive-forms}

### Use Adobe Sign's cloud-based digital signatures in Adaptive Forms {#use-adobe-sign-s-cloud-based-digital-signatures-in-adaptive-forms}

[Cloud-based digital signatures](https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/kb/digital-certificate-providers.html) or remote signatures are a new generation of digital signatures that work across desktop, mobile, and the web â€” and meet the highest levels of compliance and assurance for signer authentication. You can now [sign an Adaptive Form](../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md) with Cloud-based digital signatures.

#### Embed an Adaptive Form or Interactive Communication in AEM Sites Single Page Applications {#embed-an-adaptive-form-or-interactive-communcation-in-aem-sites-single-page-applications}

AEM Forms lets you [seamlessly embed an Adaptive Form](../../forms/using/embed-adaptive-form-aem-sites-spa.md) or Interactive Communication in an AEM Sites single page application (SPA). The embedded Adaptive Form and Interactive Communication is fully functional and users can fill and submit the form without leaving the page. It helps user remain in context of other elements on the web page and simultaneously interact with the adaptive form or Interactive Communication.

#### Sort columns of Adaptive Form tables {#sort-columns-of-adaptive-form-tables}

You can [sort any column of an Adaptive Form table](../../forms/using/adaptive-forms-tables.md#sortcolumnstable) in an ascending or descending order. You can apply sorting to table columns with static text, data model object properties, or a combination of static text and data model object properties.

#### Restrict the availability of Adaptive Forms templates to specific paths {#restrict-the-availability-of-adaptive-forms-templates-to-specific-paths}

Adaptive forms has added support for the cq:allowedPaths property. The property [restricts availability of Adaptive Forms templates to specific paths](creating-adaptive-form.md#adaptive-form-templates).

#### Add check boxes to the Adaptive Form dynamically {#add-check-boxes-to-the-adaptive-form-dynamically}

You can now define rules to [add checkboxes to the Adaptive Form dynamically](../../forms/using/rule-editor.md#setpropertyrule) based on custom function, a form object, or an object property.

## AEM Workflows {#aem-workflows}

### Use variables in AEM Workflows {#use-variables-in-aem-workflows}

Variables enable workflow steps to hold and pass metadata across workflow steps at runtime. You can create different types of variables for storing different types of data. For example, integers, strings, documents, or form data model instances. Typically, you use a variable or a collection of variables when you need to make a decision based on the value that it holds or to store information that you need later in a process.

Variables are an extension of [MetaDataMap](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/workflow/metadata/MetaDataMap.html) interface available in the previous version. It helps save time spent in developing custom ECMAScript code used to retrieve and update metadata values. You continue using MetaDataMap interface and ECMAScript code to manipulate metadata. Some benefits of using variables over MetaDataMap and ECMAScript are:

* Dynamically store, update, and use values stored in a variable across the workflow without relying on custom code
* Retrieve and update values directly to a form data model and data file (XML/JSON ) of a submitted form
* Store complete documents in a variable to perform document processing

The Go To step, OR Split step, and all AEM Forms workflow steps support variables. You can use MetaDataMap interface to access variables in workflow steps that do not have a native support for variables. For more information, see [Variables in AEM Workflows](../../forms/using/variable-in-aem-workflows.md).

![Setting a variable for in a workflow](assets/variable.png)

#### Use a workflow with different Adaptive Forms  {#use-a-workflow-with-different-adaptive-forms}

You can [specify an Adaptive Form for the assign task](../../forms/using/aem-forms-workflow-step-reference.md#assign-task-step) and document of record step of form-centric workflows on the runtime. It allows a workflow to work with different Adaptive Forms. You can decide the method to select an Adaptive Form while designing the workflow. The Adaptive Form can be located at an absolute path, submitted as payload to the workflow, or available at a path calculated using a variable.

#### Use enhanced logging capabilities of forms-centric workflow steps {#use-enhanced-logging-capabilities-of-forms-centric-workflow-steps}

Logging capabilities of forms-centric workflow steps are standardized. Now, all form-centric workflow steps produce similarly standardized logs. It helps improve debugging speed.

## Data Integration {#data-integration}

You can now:

* [Validate input data](../../forms/using/work-with-form-data-model.md#automated-validation-of-input-data) based on a list of constraints. It helps ensure that only valid data is submitted to data source.
* [Override default endpoint](../../forms/using/configure-data-sources.md#configure-soap-web-services) defined in a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file.

* [Override default](../../forms/using/configure-data-sources.md#configure-restful-web-services) [scheme, host, and base path](../../forms/using/configure-data-sources.md#configure-restful-web-services) defined in Swagger definition file.
