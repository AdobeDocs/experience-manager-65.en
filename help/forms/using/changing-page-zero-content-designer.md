# Changing Page Zero content in Designer {#changing-page-zero-content-in-designer}

Page Zero content is displayed by default when a non-Adobe PDF viewer, such as the default PDF viewer in [!DNL Chrome] or [!DNL Firefox], cannot read the content of the PDF/XFA form. The default Page Zero message is shown below.

[!DNL AEM Forms] version of Designer lets you change the message that is displayed on Page Zero. To change the Page Zero message, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have the [!DNL AEM Forms] version of Designer installed. You can check the version from the About screen of designer.

1. Open the form for which you want to change the Page Zero content.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL File]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Form Properties]**.

1. In the [!UICONTROL Form Properties] dialog, click ![plus](assets/plus.png) (Plus icon) to add a custom property.

1. Specify **_pagezerocontent** as the name of the property.
1. Add the new Page Zero message, in Rich Text format, as value. For example:


   `<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xfa="http://www.xfa.org/schema/xfa-data/1.0/"><p style="font-family:'Times';font-size:12pt;letter-spacing:0in"><span style="xfa-spacerun:yes"> </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times';font-size:12pt;letter-spacing:0in">You are seeing this message maybe because you are using a non Adobe PDF Viewer or an Old version of Adobe Reader. You can upgrade to the latest version of Adobe Reader for Windows, Mac, or Linux by visiting <span style="xfa-spacerun:yes"> </span>https://www.adobe.com/go/reader_download.</p><p style="font-family:'Times';font-size:12pt;letter-spacing:0in"><span style="xfa-spacerun:yes"> </span></p><p style="font-family:'Times';font-size:12pt;letter-spacing:0in">For more assistance with Adobe Reader visit <span style="xfa-spacerun:yes"> </span>https://www.adobe.com/go/acrreader.</p></body>`

1. Save the form as PDF.

1. View the PDF form in browser to confirm that the message is updated. The example value above appears as follows:

   ![changedmessage](assets/changedmessage.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The custom property you created may not appear properly in the Form Properties dialog when you reopen the form. However, it works fine and the form displays the updated Page Zero message.
