1. Why do barcodes and signature field in not appear in my HTML 5 form?

   Answer: Barcodes and signatures fields are not relevant in HTML or mobile scenarios. These fields appear as a non-interactive area. However, AEM Forms Designer provides a new signature scribble field that can be used instead of signature field. One can also add a [custom widget](../../forms/using/custom-widgets.md) for barcodes and integrate it.
