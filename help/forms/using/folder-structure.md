# Understanding the folder structure {#understanding-the-folder-structure}

AEM Forms workspace components are designed on MVC architecture using Backbone. Each component has a file for:

* Model, that contains business logic.
* Template, that is an HTML file containing interface controls.
* View, that acts as a Controller class to Template.

The assets for all the components are placed in the folder structure described below. To access the assets, log in to CRXDE Lite and browse to `/libs/ws/js/runtime/`.

**models** Contains backbone models.

**views** Contains backbone views.

**templates** Contains only the HTML templates for the components.

**routes** Contains universal routes. Templates folder inside routes contains the HTML code and the references to the components.

**services** Contains service interface to call Adobe Experience Manager server APIs on REST endpoint.

**util** Contains generic utilities usable by multiple components.
