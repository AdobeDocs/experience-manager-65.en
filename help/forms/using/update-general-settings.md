# Updating general settings{#updating-general-settings}

General settings of the AEM Forms app let you specify settings such as fetching attachments, offline mode, landing screen, default category, and autsave frequency.

## Updating the General settings in your app {#working-with-the-form}

When you synchronize your app with the AEM Forms server, all the forms and defined tasks are downloaded to your mobile device.

The out-of-the-box AEM Forms app solution does not download the attachments associated with each form when your app is synchronized.

In the General tab, change the download attachments, offline mode, landing screen, autosave, and synchronization settings. You can change the [Home screen](../../forms/using/home-screen.md) of your app.

**Navigate to the General tab on the Settings screen**

1. To go to the Setting screen, select the Menu button at the upper-left corner of the Home screen, and then Select **Settings**.
1. In the Settings screen, select the General tab.
