# Placeholder text in AEM Forms {#placeholder-text-in-aem-forms}

<span class="preview"> Adobe recommends using the modern and extensible data capture [Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html) for [creating new Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using/create-an-adaptive-form-core-components.md) or [adding Adaptive Forms to AEM Sites pages](/help/forms/using/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md). These components represent a significant advancement in Adaptive Forms creation, ensuring impressive user experiences. This article describes older approach to author Adaptive Forms using foundation components. </span>

The placeholder text represents a word or short phrase. It is intended to aid the user with data entry when the control has no value. A placeholder text could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format. The placeholder text is shown before the user enters a value, it is removed when the user enters or selects a value.

>The placeholder text, if specified, must have a value that contains no new line characters.
