# Drafts and submissions component{#drafts-and-submissions-component}

The Drafts & Submissions component lists all the forms that are in the draft state and the forms that are already submitted. The component has separate sections (tabs) for drafts and submitted forms. The users can view only their drafts and submitted forms.

## Configuring the component {#configuring-the-component}

The Drafts & Submissions component has two tabs: Drafts and Submissions.

To enable submission of an adaptive form to appear in the submissions tab, set the **Submit action** to **[Forms Portal Submit Action](../../forms/using/configuring-submit-actions.md). Alternatively,** enable the Forms Portal Submit option. Whenever, a user submits the form, the form is added to the submissions tab.

The drafts functionality is enabled out of the box. When a user clicks **Save** on an adaptive form, the form is added to the drafts tab.

Perform the following steps to add and configure a Drafts & Submissions component:

1. Drag-and-drop the **Drafts & Submissions** component under Document Services category in the components browser on to your page.
1. Select the component and then select ![settings_icon](assets/settings_icon.png) to open the Edit dialog for the component.

## Customizing the storage {#customizing-the-storage}

When you use the Forms Portal submit action or enable the Store data in forms portal option in adaptive form, the form data is stored in AEM repository. In a production environment, it is recommended not to store draft or submitted form data in AEM repository. Instead, you must integrate the drafts and submission component with a secure storage like enterprise database to store drafts and submitted forms data.

Forms portal lets you store data at local AEM repository, remote AEM repository, or to a database. AEM Forms lets you customize the implementation of storing user data for drafts and submissions. You can override default methods to specify how draft and submissions data is stored at a storage of your choice. For example, you can store the data in a data store currently implemented in your organization.

Forms portal provides out of the box services (APIs) to store data on crx-repository of local and remote AEM Forms publish instances. You can replace the default implementations, described in [Configuring storage services for drafts and submissions](/help/forms/using/configuring-draft-submission-storage.md) article, with custom implementations to replace default functionality. For detailed information about the methods required in a custom implementation to store content at a secured location, see [Customizing Draft and Submission data services](/help/forms/using/custom-draft-submission-data-services.md) and [Custom storage for drafts and submissions component.](/help/forms/using/adding-custom-storage-provider-forms.md)

AEM Forms documentation provides a [Sample for integrating drafts & submissions component with database](integrate-draft-submission-database.md). You can use the sample implementation to develop your own custom implementation.
