`javax.jcr.RepositoryException: Applying repoinit operation failed despite retry; set loglevel to DEBUG to see all exceptions. Last exception message was: Failed to set ACL (javax.jcr.ValueFormatException: Invalid type: 0) AclLine ALLOW {principals=[forms-xfa-writers], privileges=[jcr:modifyProperties]} restrictions=[rep:glob=[*/jcr:content/*], rep:itemNames=[xfaForm], fd:condition=[xfaForm, 1]]`

## Solution

To restart the AEM SDK, go to active command window and press `Ctrl + C` command to restart the SDK.
