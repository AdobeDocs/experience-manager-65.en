# Analytics using [!DNL Adobe Launch] {#analyticsusingadobelaunch}

AEM Forms integrates with [Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-learn/tutorials/overview.html?lang=en) to let you capture and track performance metrics for your published forms. The objective behind analyzing these metrics is to enable business users to gain insights into end user behavior and optimize the data capture experience. You can capture and track behavior of both logged-in and not logged-in (Anonymous) users via Adobe Analytics for Adaptive Forms.

You can also perform analytics using Cloud Service Framework. For more information on how to integrate AEM Forms with Cloud Service Framework, see [Analytics using Cloud Service Framework](/help/forms/using/configure-analytics-forms-documents.md). The main advantage of using Adobe Launch over Analytics using Cloud Service Framework is that you can also define custom events, in addition to these out of the box events. The customized events are defined using rule editor or customer clientlibs and are mapped to events in [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

After performing the actions mentioned in this article, you can configure and view reports in [!DNL Adobe Analytics], as demonstrated in the following video:

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/337262)

You can use [!DNL Adobe Analytics] to discover interaction patterns and problems users face while using adaptive forms. Out of the box, [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tracks and stores information about the following events:

* **Render**: Number of times a form is opened.

* **Submit**: Number of times a form is submitted.

* **Abandon**: Number of times the users leave without completing the form.

* **Error**: Number of errors encountered on the panel and on the fields of the panel.

* **Help**: Number of times a user opens help of a panel and the fields of the panel.

* **Field Visit**: Number of times a user visits a field in the form.

* **Save**: Number of times users save a form to the Forms Portal.

Apart from these out of the box events, you can also define custom events. 

The following figure illustrates the actions that you need to perform before viewing reports in [!DNL Adobe Analytics]:

1. Select the report suite name in the **[!UICONTROL Development Report Suites]**, **[!UICONTROL Staging Report Suites]**, and **[!UICONTROL Product Report Suites]** drop-down lists and select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the extension.

### Configure data elements {#configure-data-elements}

You can select any of the configured data elements in a rule created for an event. When an event occurs on an adaptive form, AEM Forms sends these data elements to [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

After installing the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Forms]** extension, you can create the following data elements:

<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>FieldName</th>
   <td>FieldTitle</th>
   <td>FormInstance</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FormName<br /> </td>
   <td>FormTitle<br /> </td>
   <td>PageName</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>PageURL<br /> </td>
   <td>PanelTitle<br /> </td>
   <td>TimeSpent</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

Perform the following steps to configure data elements:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Authoring]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Data Elements]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create New Data Element]**.

1. Specify a name for the Data Element. For example, Form Title for FormTitle data element type.

1. Specify **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Forms]** as the Extension name.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Data Element Type]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the data element.

### Configure rules {#configure-rules}

Perform the following steps to create rules based on the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Forms]** extension:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Authoring]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Rules]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create New Rule]**.

1.  Specify a name for the Rule. For example, Form Submit to record form submissions.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Events]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

1. Specify **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Forms]** as the Extension name.

1. Select the event type. The input for the **[!UICONTROL Name]** field populates automatically based on the selected event type.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the event.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

1. Specify **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]** as the Extension name.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Set Variables]** as the Action Type. The options available in the drop-down list include:

   * **[!UICONTROL Set Variables]**: Use this action type to define the event type for which the selected data elements are sent from AEM Forms to [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

   * **[!UICONTROL Send Beacon]**: Use this action type to send data from AEM Forms to [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

   * **[!UICONTROL Clear Variables]**: Use this action type to clear the data trail so that the event registers only once in [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

     The recommended approach is to use the **[!UICONTROL Set Variables]** action type to configure the event and data elements, then use **[!UICONTROL Send Beacon]** to send data, and then use **[!UICONTROL Clear Variables]** to clear the data trail.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Props]** section, map the report suite options available in the drop-down list with the data elements defined using [Configure data elements](#configure-data-elements).

   For example, to send **Form Title** data element from AEM Forms to [!DNL Adobe Analytics] when you submit a form:
   1. In the **[!UICONTROL Props]** section, select a prop for Form Title available in the report suite and then select ![Database icon](/help/forms/using/assets/database-icon.svg) to map it to Form Title created in [Configure data elements](#configure-data-elements).

      ![define-props](/help/forms/using/assets/define-props.png)

   1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add Another]** to add more data elements to the list.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Events]** section, select an event from the options available in the report suite and select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, select + and specify **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]** as the Extension name.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Send Beacon]** as the Action Type. In the right pane, Select **[!UICONTROL s.t()]** to send data to [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and treat it as a page view or **[!UICONTROL s.tl()]** to send data to [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and do not treat it as a page view. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section, select + and specify **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]** as the Extension name.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Clear Variables]** as the Action Type. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]**. After performing these steps, the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section displays as:
   ![Actions Configuration](/help/forms/using/assets/actions-config.png)

    Customize the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section according to your requirements. For example, you can define two **Send Beacon** steps in an Actions flow to send data to [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and treat it as a page view in one step and send data to [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and do not treat it as a page view in the second step.

   ![Actions Configuration](/help/forms/using/assets/actions-config-2.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the rule. 
   
   You can create rules for all event types, such as Abandon, Error, Field Visit, Help, Render, Save, and Submit.
