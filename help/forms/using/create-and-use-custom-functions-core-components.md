## Introduction

AEM Forms 6.5 includes JavaScript functions that allow you to define complex business rules by using the rule editor. While AEM Forms offers a variety of out-of-the-box custom functions, many use cases require defining your own custom functions to use across multiple forms. These custom functions enhance the capabilities of forms by enabling the manipulation and processing of entered data to meet specific requirements. Additionally, they allow for dynamic alteration of form behavior based on the predefined criteria.

### Uses of custom functions {#uses-of-custom-function}

Advantages of using Custom Functions in Adaptive Forms Core Components are:


* **Managing data**: Custom functions manage and process data entered into the forms fields.
* **Processing of data**: Custom functions help process data entered into the forms fields.
* **Validation of data**: Custom functions enable you to perform custom checks on form inputs and provide specified error messages.
* **Dynamic behavior**: Custom functions allow you to control the dynamic behavior of your forms based on specific conditions. For example, you can show/hide fields, modify field values, or adjust form logic dynamically.
* **Integration**: You can use custom functions to integrate with external APIs or services. It helps in fetching data from external sources, sending data to external Rest endpoints, or performing custom actions based on external events.

Custom functions are essentially client libraries that are added in the JavaScript file. Once you create a Custom Function, it becomes available in the rule editor for selection by the user in an Adaptive Form. The custom functions are identified by the JavaScript annotations in the rule editor.

### Supported JavaScript annotations for custom function {#js-annotations}

**JavaScript annotations provides metadata for JavaScript code**. It includes comments that start with specific symbols for example, `/**` and `@`. The annotations provide important information about functions, variables, and other elements in the code. Adaptive Form supports the following JavaScript annotations for custom functions:

#### Name

The **Name** is used to identify the custom function in the rule editor of an Adaptive form. Following syntaxes are used to name a Custom Function:

* `@name [functionName] <Function Name>`
* `@function [functionName] <Function Name>`
* `@func [functionName] <Function Name>`

>[!NOTE]
>`[functionName]` is the name of the function. Spaces are not allowed.
>`<Function Name>` is the display name of the function in the rule editor of Adaptive Forms.
>If the function name is identical to the name of the function itself, you can omit `[functionName]` from the syntax.

#### Parameter

 The **Parameter** is a list of arguments used by custom functions. A function can support multiple parameters. The following syntaxes are used to define a parameter in a custom function:

* `@param {type} name <Parameter Description>`
* `@argument` `{type} name <Parameter Description>` 
* `@arg` `{type}` `name <Parameter Description>`

    `{type}` represents the parameter type. The allowed parameter types are:
    
    * string: Represents a single string value.
    * number: Represents a single numeric value.
    * boolean: Represents a single boolean value (true or false).
    * string[]: Represents an array of string values.
    * number[]: Represents an array of numeric values.
    * boolean[]: Represents an array of boolean values.
    * date: Represents a single date value.
    * date[]: Represents an array of date values.
    * array: Represents a generic array containing values of various types.
    * object: Represents form object passed to a custom function instead of passing its value directly.
    * scope: Represents the globals object, which contains read-only variables such as form instances, target field instances, and methods for performing form modifications within the custom functions. It is declared as the last parameter in the JavaScript annotations and is not visible to the rule editor of an Adaptive Form. The scope parameter accesses the object of the form or component to trigger the rule or event required for form processing. For further information on the Globals object and how to use it, [click here](/help/forms/using/create-and-use-custom-functions-core-components.md#field-and-global-scope-objects-in-custom-functions-support-field-and-global-objects)
    
The Parameter type is **not case-sensitive** and spaces are not allowed in the parameter name.
 
`<Parameter Description>` contains details about the purpose of the parameter. It can have multiple words.

<!--

**Optional Parameters**
By default, all parameters are mandatory. You can define a parameter as optional by either adding `=` after the parameter type or enclosing the parameter name in `[]`. Parameters defined as optional in JavaScript annotations are displayed as optional in the rule editor.
To define a variable as an optional parameter, you can use the any of the following syntaxes:
  
* `@param {type=} Input1`

In the above line of code, `Input1` is an optional parameter without any default value. To declare optional parameter with default value:

`@param {string=<value>} input1`
        
`input1` as an optional parameter with the default value set to `value`. 

* `@param {type} [Input1]`

In the above line of code, `Input1` is an optional parameter without any default value. To declare optional parameter with default value:

`@param {array} [input1=<value>]`

    `input1` is an optional parameter of array type with the default value set to `value`. 
    Ensure that the parameter type is enclosed in curly brackets {} and the parameter name is enclosed in square brackets []. 

Consider the following code snippet, where input2 is defined as an optional parameter:

```javascript

        /**
         * optional parameter function
         * @name OptionalParameterFunction
         * @param {string} input1 
         * @param {string=} input2 
         * @return {string}
        */
        function OptionalParameterFunction(input1, input2) {
        let result = "Result: ";
        result += input1;
        if (input2 !== null) {
            result += " " + input2;
        }
        return result;
        }
```

The following illustration displays using the `OptionalParameterFunction` csutom function in the rule editor:

![Optional or required parameters ](/help/forms/using/assets/optional-default-params.png)

You can save the rule without specifying a value for required parameters, but the rule is not executed and displays a warning message as:

![incomplete rule warning](/help/forms/using/assets/incomplete-rule.png)

When user leaves the optional parameter empty, then the "Undefined" value is passed to the custom function for the optional parameter.

To learn more about how to define optional parameters in JSDocs, [click here](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param).

-->
    
#### Return Type

The return type specifies the type of value that the custom function returns after execution. The following syntaxes are used to define a return type in a custom function:

* `@return {type}`
* `@returns {type}`
`{type}` represents the return type of the function. The allowed return types are:
* string: Represents a single string value.
* number: Represents a single numeric value.
* boolean: Represents a single boolean value (true or false).
* string[]: Represents an array of string values.
* number[]: Represents an array of numeric values.
* boolean[]: Represents an array of boolean values.
* date: Represents a single date value.
* date[]: Represents an array of date values.
* array: Represents a generic array containing values of various types.
* object: Represents form object instead of its value directly.

The return type is not case-sensitive.

#### Private

  The custom function, declared as private, does not appear in the list of custom functions in the rule editor of an Adaptive form. By default, custom functions are public. The syntax to declare custom function as private is `@private`.

<!--
#### Member

  Syntax: `@memberof namespace`
  Attaches a namespace to the function.
-->

<!--

#### This

   Syntax: `@this currentComponent`

   Use @this to refer to the Adaptive Form component on which the rule is written. 
  
   The following example is based on the field value. In the following example, the rule hides a field in the form. The `this` portion of `this.value` refers to underlying Adaptive Form component, on which the rule is written.

   ```
      /**
      * @function myTestFunction
      * @this currentComponent
      * @param {scope} scope in which code inside function will be executed.
      */
      myTestFunction = function (scope) {
         if(this.value == "O"){
               scope.age.visible = true;
         } else {
            scope.age.visible = false;
         }
      }

   ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Comments before custom function are used for summary. Summary can extend to multiple lines until a tag is encountered. Limit the size to a single for a concise description in the rule builder.

<!--

## Function declaration supported types {#function-declaration-supported-types}

**Function Statement**

```javascript
function area(len) {
    return len*len;
}
```

This function is included without `jsdoc` comments.

**Function Expression**

```javascript
var area;
//Some codes later
/** */
area = function(len) {
    return len*len;
};
```

**Function Expression and Statement**

```javascript
var b={};
/** */
b.area = function(len) {
    return len*len;
}
```

**Function Declaration as Variable**

```javascript
/** */
var x1,
    area = function(len) {
        return len*len;
    },
    x2 =5, x3 =true;
```

Limitation: custom function picks only the first function declaration from the variable list, if together. You can use function expression for every function declared.

**Function Declaration as Object**

```javascript
var c = {
    b : {
        /** */
        area : function(len) {
            return len*len;
        }
    }
};
```
-->

## Guidelines while creating custom functions {#considerations}

To list the custom functions in the rule editor, you can use any one of the following formats:

### Function statement with or without jsdoc comments

You can create a custom function with or without jsdoc comments. 

```javascript

    function functionName(parameters) 
        {
            // code to be executed
        }

```

If the user does not add any JavaScript annotations to the custom function, it is listed in the rule editor by its function name. However, it is recommended to include JavaScript annotations for improved readability of the custom functions.


### Arrow function with mandatory JavaScript annotations or comment

You can create a custom function with an arrow function syntax:

```javascript
    /**
    * test function
    * @name testFunction 
    * @param {string} a parameter description
    * @param {string=} b parameter description
    * @return {string}
    */
    testFunction = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
    };
    /** */
    testFunction1=(a) => (return a)
    /** */
    testFunction2 = a => a + 100;
    
```

If the user does not add any JavaScript annotations to the custom function, the custom function is not listed in the rule editor of an Adaptive Form.

### Function expression with mandatory JavaScript annotations or comment

To list custom functions in the rule editor of an Adaptive Form, create custom functions in the following format:

```javascript
    /**
    * test function
    * @name testFunction 
    * @param {string} input1 parameter description
    * @param {string=} input2 parameter description
    * @return {string}
    */
    testFunction = function(input1,input2)
        {
            // code to be executed
        }
```

If the user does not add any JavaScript annotations to the custom function, the custom function is not listed in the rule editor of an Adaptive Form.

### Prerequisites to create a custom function

Before you begin adding a custom function to your Adaptive Forms, ensure you have the following Software installed on your machine:

* **Plain Text Editor (IDE)**: While any plain text editor can work, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Microsoft Visual Studio Code offers advanced features for easier editing.

* **Git:** This version control system is required for managing code changes. If you do not have it installed, download it from https://git-scm.com.


## Create a custom function {#create-custom-function}

Steps to create custom functions are:
1. [Create a client side library using the AEM Project Archetype and add a custom function](#create-client-library-archetype)
OR
[Create custom functions through CRXDE](#create-add-custom-function)
1. [Add client library to an Adaptive Form](#add-client-library)
1. [Use custom function in an Adaptive Form](#use-custom-functions)


### Create a client library using the AEM Project Archetype{#create-client-library-archetype}

You can add custom functions by adding a client library to the project created [using the AEM Project Archetype](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/using#getting-started).
If you have an existing project <!--and have already the project structure as shown in the image below,--> you can directly add [custom functions](#create-add-custom-function) to your local project.

<!--![custom fuction folder structure](assets/custom-library-folder-structure.png)-->

After you create an Archetype Project or use an existing project, create a client library. To create a client library perform the following steps:

**Add a Client Library Folder**

To add new client library folder to your [AEM project directory], follow the steps:

1. Open the [AEM project directory] in an editor.

    ![custom fuction folder structure](assets/custom-library-folder-structure.png)

1. Locate `ui.apps`.
1. Add new folder. For example, add a folder named as `experience-league`.
1. Navigate to `/experience-league/` folder and add a `ClientLibraryFolder`. For example, create a client library folder named as `customclientlibs`.

   Location is: `[AEM project directory]/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/`

**Add files and folders to the Client Library folder**

Add the following to the added client library folder:
    
* `.content.xml` file
* `js.txt` file
* `js` folder 

`Location is: [AEMaaCS project directory]/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/experience-league/customclientlibs/` 

1. In the `.content.xml` add the following lines of code:
    
    ```javascript
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <jcr:root xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="cq:ClientLibraryFolder"
    categories="[customfunctionscategory]"/>
    ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > You can choose any name for `client library folder` and `categories` property.

1. In the `js.txt` add the following lines of code:
   
    ```javascript
          #base=js
        function.js
    ```

1. In the `js` folder, add the javascript file as `function.js` which includes the custom functions:

    ```javascript
    /**
        * Calculates Age
        * @name calculateAge
        * @param {object} field
        * @return {string} 
    */

    function calculateAge(field) {
    var dob = new Date(field);
    var now = new Date();

    var age = now.getFullYear() - dob.getFullYear();
    var monthDiff = now.getMonth() - dob.getMonth();

    if (monthDiff < 0 || (monthDiff === 0 && now.getDate() < dob.getDate())) {
    age--;
    }

    return age;
    }
    
    ```

1. Save the files.

 ![custom fuction folder structure](assets/custom-function-added-files.png)

**Include the new folder in filter.xml**:

1. Navigate to the `/ui.apps/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml` file in your [AEMaaCS project directory].

1. Open the file and add the following line at the end:

    `<filter root="/apps/experience-league" />`
1. Save the file.

    ![custom fuction filter xml](assets/custom-function-filterxml.png)

1. Build the newly created client library folder to your AEM environment by following the steps given in [How to Build section](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/tree/develop/src/main/archetype#how-to-build).

## Create and deploy custom functions through CRXDE{#create-add-custom-function}

If you are using the latest AEM Forms and Forms add-on, you can create a custom function through CRXDE to use the latest updates of custom functions. To do so, perform the following steps:

<!--![custom fuction folder structure](assets/custom-library-folder-structure.png)-->


1. Log into `http://server:port/crx/de/index.jsp#`. 
1. Create a folder under the `/apps` folder. For example, create a folder named as `experience-league`.
1. Save your changes.
1. Navigate to the created folder and create a node of type `cq:ClientLibraryFolder` as `clientlibs`.
1. Navigate to the newly created `clientlibs` folder and add the `allowProxy` and `categories` properties:
    
    ![Custom Library node properties](/help/forms/using/assets/customlibrary-catproperties.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can provide any name in place of `customfunctionsdemo`.

1. Save your changes.

1. Create a folder called `js` under the `clientlibs` folder.
1. Create a JavaScript file called `functions.js` under the `js` folder.
1. Create a file called `js.txt` under the `clientlibs` folder.
1. Save your changes.
The created folder structure looks like:

    ![Created Client Library Folder Structure](/help/forms/using/assets/clientlibrary_folderstructure.png)
1. Double-click the `functions.js` file to open the editor. The file comprises the code for custom function.
    Let's add the following code to the JavaScript file to calculate age based on the Date of Birth(YYYY-MM-DD).

    ```javascript

        /**
             * Calculates Age
             * @name calculateAge 
             * @return {string} 
        */

        function calculateAge(dateOfBirthString) {
        var dob = new Date(dateOfBirthString);
        var now = new Date();
    
        var age = now.getFullYear() - dob.getFullYear();
        var monthDiff = now.getMonth() - dob.getMonth();
    
        if (monthDiff < 0 || (monthDiff === 0 && now.getDate() < dob.getDate())) {
        age--;
        }
    
        return age;
        }

    ```
        
1. Save `function.js`.
1. Navigate to `js.txt` and add the following code:
  
    ```javascript
        #base=js
        functions.js
    ```

1. Save the `js.txt` file.     

You can refer to the following [custom function](/help/forms/using/assets/customfunction.zip) folder. Download and install this folder on your AEM instance.

Now, you can use the custom function in your Adaptive Form by adding the client library.

## Add client library in an Adaptive Form{#add-client-library}

Once you have deployed your client library to your AEM Forms environment, use its capabilities in your Adaptive Form. To add the client library in your Adaptive Form

1. Open your form in the edit mode. To open a form in the edit mode, select a form and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.
1. Open the Content browser, and select the **[!UICONTROL Guide Container]** component of your Adaptive Form.
1. Click the Guide Container properties icon. The Adaptive Form Container dialog box opens.  
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Basic]** tab and select the name of the **[!UICONTROL client library category]** from the drop-down list (in this case, select `customfunctionscategory`).

   ![Adding the custom function client library](/help/forms/using//assets/custom-function-category-name-core-component.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

Now, you can create a rule to use custom functions in the rule editor:

![Adding the custom function client library](/help/forms/using//assets/calculateage-customfunction.png)

Now, let's understand how to configure and use a custom function using the [Rule Editor's Invoke service in AEM Forms 6.5](/help/forms/using/rule-editor-core-components.md#invoke-form-data-model-service-invoke)

## Using Custom Function in an Adaptive Form {#use-custom-functions}

In an Adaptive Form, you can use [Custom Functions within the rule editor](/help/forms/using/rule-editor-core-components.md).
Let us add the following code to the JavaScript file (`Function.js` file) to calculate age based on the Date of Birth (YYYY-MM-DD). Create a custom function as `calculateAge()` which takes the date of birth as input and returns age:

```javascript
    /**
        * Calculates Age
        * @name calculateAge
        * @param {object} field
        * @return {string} 
    */

    function calculateAge(field) {
    var dob = new Date(field);
    var now = new Date();

    var age = now.getFullYear() - dob.getFullYear();
    var monthDiff = now.getMonth() - dob.getMonth();

    if (monthDiff < 0 || (monthDiff === 0 && now.getDate() < dob.getDate())) {
    age--;
    }

    return age;
    }

```

In the above example, when the user enters the date of birth in the format (YYYY-MM-DD), the custom function `calculateAge` is invoked and returns the age. 

![Calculate Age custom function in Rule Editor](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-calculate-age.png)

Let's preview the form to observe how the custom functions are implemented through the rule editor:

![Calculate Age custom function in Rule Editor Form Preview](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-age-calculate-form.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can refer to the following [custom functions](/help/forms/using/assets/customfunctions.zip) folder. Download and install this folder in your AEM instance using the [Package Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/sites/administering/contentmanagement/package-manager).

### Support for asynchronous functions in custom functions {#support-of-async-functions}

Asynchronous custom functions do not appear in the rule editor list. However, it is possible to invoke asynchronous functions within custom functions created using synchronous function expressions.

 ![Sync and async custom function](/help/forms/using/assets/workflow-for-sync-async-custom-fumction.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
> The advantage of calling asynchronous functions in custom functions is that asynchronous functions allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks, with the result of each function used within the custom functions.

Look at the code below to see how we can invoke asynchronous functions using custom functions:

```javascript
    
    async function asyncFunction() {
    const response = await fetch('https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/inventory');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
    }

    /**
    * callAsyncFunction
    * @name callAsyncFunction callAsyncFunction
    */
    function callAsyncFunction() {
    asyncFunction()
        .then(responseData => {
        console.log('Response data:', responseData);
        })
        .catch(error => {
         console.error('Error:', error);
    });
}

```

In the above example, the asyncFunction function is an `asynchronous function`. It performs an asynchronous operation by making a `GET` request to `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/inventory`. It waits for the response using `await`, parses the response body as JSON using the `response.json()`, and then returns the data. The `callAsyncFunction` function is a synchronous custom function that invokes the `asyncFunction` function and displays the response data in the console. Although the `callAsyncFunction` function is synchronous, it calls the asynchronous asyncFunction function and handles its result with `then` and `catch` statements.

To see its working, let us add a button and create a rule for the button that invokes the asynchronous function upon a button click.

 ![creating rule for async function](/help/forms/using/assets/rule-for-async-funct.png)

Refer to the illustration of the console window below to demonstrate that when the user clicks the `Fetch` button, the custom function `callAsyncFunction` is invoked, which in turn calls an asynchronous function `asyncFunction`. Inspect the console window to view the response upon the button click:

 ![Console window](/help/forms/using/assets/async-custom-funct-console.png)

Let's dive into the features of custom functions.

## Various features for Custom Functions
  
You can use custom functions to add personalized features to forms. These functions support various abilities such as working with specific fields, using global fields, or caching. This flexibility allows you to customize forms according to your organization's requirements.

### Field and Global scope objects in custom functions {#support-field-and-global-objects}

Field objects refers to the individual components or elements within a form, such as text fields, checkboxes. The Globals object contains read-only variables such as form instance, target field instance and methods to do form modifications within custom functions. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> The `param {scope} globals` has to be the last parameter and it is not displayed in the rule editor of an Adaptive Form.

<!-- Let us look at the following code snippet:

```JavaScript
   
    /**
    * updateDateTime
    * @name updateDateTime
    * @param {object} field
    * @param {scope} globals
    */
    function updateDateTime(field, globals) {
    // Accessing the Date object from the global scope
    var currentDate = new Date();
    // Formatting the date and time
    var formattedDateTime = currentDate.toLocaleString();
    // Updating the field value with the formatted date and time using setProperty.
    globals.functions.setProperty(field, {value: formattedDateTime});
    }
```

In the above code snippet, a custom function named `updateDateTime` takes parameters such as a field object and a global object. The field represents the textbox object where the formatted date and time value is displayed within the form. -->

Let's learn how custom functions use field and global objects with the help of a `Contact Us` form using different usecases.

![Contact Us Form](/help/forms/using/assets/contact-us-form.png)

#### **Use Case**: Show a panel using the `SetProperty` rule

Add the following code in the custom function as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to set the form field as `Required`.

```javascript
    
    /**
    * enablePanel
    * @name enablePanel
    * @param {object} field1
    * @param {object} field2
    * @param {scope} globals 
    */

    function enablePanel(field1,field2, globals)
    {
       if(globals.functions.validate(field1).length === 0)
       {
       globals.functions.setProperty(field2, {visible: true});
       }
    }
```

>[!NOTE]
>
> * You can configure the field properties using the available properties located in `[form-path]/jcr:content/guideContainer.model.json`.
> * Modifications made to the form using the `setProperty` method of the Globals object are asynchronous in nature and are not reflected during the execution of the custom function.

In this example, validation of the `personaldetails` panel occurs upon clicking the button. If no errors are detected in the panel, another panel, the `feedback` panel, becomes visible upon button click.

Let's create a rule for the `Next` button, which validates the `personaldetails` panel and makes the `feedback`  panel visible when the user clicks the `Next` button.

![Set Property](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-set-property.png)

Refer to the illustration below to demonstrate where the `personaldetails` panel is validated upon clicking the `Next` button. In case all the fields within the `personaldetails` are validated, the `feedback` panel becomes visible.

![Set Property Form Preview](/help/forms/using/assets/set-property-form-preview.png)

If errors are present in the fields of the `personaldetails` panel, they are displayed at the field level upon clicking the `Next` button, and the `feedback` panel remains invisible.

![Set Property Form Preview](/help/forms/using/assets/set-property-panel.png)

#### **Use Case**: Validate the field.

Add the following code in the custom function as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to validate the field.

```javascript

    /**
    * validateField
    * @name validateField
    * @param {object} field
    * @param {scope} globals
    */
    function validateField(field,globals)
    {
    
        globals.functions.validate(field);
    
    }   
```

>[!NOTE]
>
> If no argument is passed in the `validate()` function, it validates the form.

In this example, a custom validation pattern is applied to the `contact` field. Users are required to input a phone number starting with `10` followed by `8` digits. If the user enters a phone number that does not start with `10` or contains more or less than `8` digits, a validation error message appears upon the button click:

![Email Address Validation Pattern](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-validation-pattern.png)

Now, next step is to create a rule for the `Next` button that validates the `contact` field on the button click.

![Validation Pattern](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-validate.png)

Refer to the illustration below to demonstrate that if the user enters a phone number that does not start with `10`, an error message appears at the field level:

![Email Address Validation Pattern](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-validate-error-message.png)

If the user enters a valid phone number and all fields in the `personaldetails` panel are validated, the `feedback` panel appears on the screen:

![Email Address Validation Pattern](/help/forms/using/assets/validate-form-preview-form.png)

#### **Use Case**: Reset a panel

Add the following code in the custom function as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to reset the panel.

```javascript
    /**
    * resetField
    * @name  resetField
    * @param {string} input1
    * @param {object} field
    * @param {scope} globals 
    */
    function  resetField(field,globals)
    {
    
        globals.functions.reset(field);
    
    }
```

>[!NOTE]
>
> If no argument is passed in the `reset()` function, it validates the form.

In this example, the `personaldetails` panel resets upon clicking the `Clear` button. Next step is to create a rule for the `Clear` button that resets the panel on the button click.

![Clear button](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-reset-field.png)

See the illustration below to display that if the user clicks the `clear` button, the `personaldetails` panel resets:

![Reset Form](assets/custom-function-reset-form.png)

#### **Use Case**: To display custom message at the field level and marking the field as invalid

You can use the `markFieldAsInvalid()` function to define a field as invalid and set custom error message at a field level. The `fieldIdentifier` value can be `fieldId`, or `field qualifiedName`, or `field dataRef`. The value of the object named `option` can be `{useId: true}`, `{useQualifiedName: true}`, or `{useDataRef: true}`. 
The syntaxes used to mark field as invalid and set custom message are:

* `globals.functions.markFieldAsInvalid(field.$id,"[custom message]",{useId: true});`
* `globals.functions.markFieldAsInvalid(field.$qualifiedName, "[custom message]", {useQualifiedName: true});`
* `globals.functions.markFieldAsInvalid(field.$dataRef, "[custom message]", {useDataRef: true});`

Add the following code in the custom function as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to enable custom message at the field level.

```javascript

    /**
    * customMessage
    * @name customMessage
    * @param {object} field
    * @param {scope} globals 
    */
    function customMessage(field, globals) {
    const minLength = 15;
    const comments = field.$value.trim();
    if (comments.length < minLength) {
        globals.functions.markFieldAsInvalid(field.$id, "Comments must be at least 15 characters long.", { useId: true });
    }
}
```

In this example, if the user enters less than 15 characters in the comments textbox, a custom message appears at the field level.

Next step is to create a rule for the `comments` field:

![Mark field as Invalid](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-invalid-field.png)

See the demonstration below to display that entering negative feedback in the `comments` field triggers the display of a custom message at the field level:

![Mark field as Invalid Preview form](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-invalidfield-form.png)

If the user enters more than 15 characters in commments textbox, the field gets validated and form is submitted:

![Mark field as valid Preview form](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-validfield-form.png)


#### **Use Case**: Submit altered data to the server

The following line of code: 
`globals.functions.submitForm(globals.functions.exportData(), false);` is used to submit the form data after manipulation. 
* The first argument is the data to be submitted. 
* The second argument represents whether the form is to be validated before submission. It is `optional` and set as `true` by default. 
* The third argument is the `contentType` of the submission, which is also optional with the default value as `multipart/form-data`. The other values can be `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  
Add the following code in the custom function as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to submit the manipulated data at the server:

```javascript

    /**
    * submitData
    * @name submitData
    * @param {object} field
    * @param {scope} globals 
    */
    function submitData(globals)
    {
    
    var data = globals.functions.exportData();
    if(!data.comments) {
    data.comments = 'NA';
    }
    console.log('After update:{}',data);
    globals.functions.submitForm(data, false);
    }

```

In this example, if the user leaves the `comments` textbox empty, the `NA` is submitted to the server at form submission.

Now create a rule for the `Submit` button which submits data:

![Submit data](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-submit-data.png)

Refer to the illustration of the `console window` below to demonstrate that if the user leaves the `comments` textbox empty, then the value as `NA` is submitted at the server:

![Submit data at the console window](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-submit-data-form.png)

You can also inspect the console window to view the data submitted to the server:

![Inspect data at the console window](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-submit-data-console-data.png)

<!--

#### **Use Case**: Display form submission and failure messages for custom submit action 

Add the following line of code as explained in the [create-custom-function ](#create-custom-function) section, to customize the submission or failure message for form submissions and display the form submission messages in a modal box:

```javascript
/**
 * Handles the success response after a form submission.
 *
 * @param {scope} globals - This object contains a read-only form instance, target field instance, triggered event, and methods for performing form modifications within custom functions.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function customSubmitSuccessHandler(globals) {
    var event = globals.event;
    var submitSuccessResponse = event.payload.body;
    var form = globals.form;

    if (submitSuccessResponse) {
        if (submitSuccessResponse.redirectUrl) {
            window.location.href = encodeURI(submitSuccessResponse.redirectUrl);
        } else if (submitSuccessResponse.thankYouMessage) {
            showModal("success", submitSuccessResponse.thankYouMessage);
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Handles the error response after a form submission.
 *
 * @param {string} customSubmitErrorMessage - The custom error message.
 * @param {scope} globals - This object contains a read-only form instance, target field instance, triggered event, and methods for performing form modifications within custom functions.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function customSubmitErrorHandler(customSubmitErrorMessage, globals) {
    showModal("error", customSubmitErrorMessage);
}
function showModal(type, message) {
    // Remove any existing modals
    var existingModal = document.getElementById("modal");
    if (existingModal) {
        existingModal.remove();
    }

    // Create the modal dialog
    var modal = document.createElement("div");
    modal.setAttribute("id", "modal");
    modal.setAttribute("class", "modal");

    // Create the modal content
    var modalContent = document.createElement("div");
    modalContent.setAttribute("class", "modal-content");

    // Create the modal header
    var modalHeader = document.createElement("div");
    modalHeader.setAttribute("class", "modal-header");
    modalHeader.innerHTML = "<h2>" + (type === "success" ? "Thank You" : "Error") + "</h2>";

    // Create the modal body
    var modalBody = document.createElement("div");
    modalBody.setAttribute("class", "modal-body");
    modalBody.innerHTML = "<p class='" + type + "-message'>" + message + "</p>";

    // Create the modal footer
    var modalFooter = document.createElement("div");
    modalFooter.setAttribute("class", "modal-footer");

    // Create the close button
    var closeButton = document.createElement("button");
    closeButton.setAttribute("class", "close-button");
    closeButton.innerHTML = "Close";
    closeButton.onclick = function() {
        modal.remove();
    };

    // Append the elements to the modal content
    modalFooter.appendChild(closeButton);
    modalContent.appendChild(modalHeader);
    modalContent.appendChild(modalBody);
    modalContent.appendChild(modalFooter);

    // Append the modal content to the modal
    modal.appendChild(modalContent);

    // Append the modal to the document body
    document.body.appendChild(modal);
}
```

In this example, when the user uses the `customSubmitSuccessHandler` and `customSubmitErrorHandler` custom functions, the success and failure messages are displayed in a modal. The JavaScript function `showModal(type, message)` is used to dynamically create and display a modal dialog box on a screen.

Now, create a rule for successful form submission:

![Form submission success](/help/forms/using/assets/form-submission-success.png)

Refer to the illustration below to demonstrate that when the form is submitted successfully, the success message is displayed in a modal:

![Form submission success message](/help/forms/using/assets/form-submission-success-message.png )
 
Similarly, let us create a rule for failed form submissions:

![Form submission fail](/help/forms/using/assets/form-submission-fail.png)

Refer to the illustration below to demonstrate that when the form submission fails, the error message is displayed in a modal:

![Form submission fail message](/help/forms/using/assets/form-submission-fail-message.png )

To display form submission success and failure in a default manner, the `Default submit Form Success Handler` and `Default submit Form Error Handler` functions are available out of the box.

In case, the custom submit action fails to perform as expected in existing AEM projects or forms, refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Caching support for custom function

Adaptive Forms implement caching for custom functions to enhance response time while retrieving the custom function list in the rule editor. A message as `Fetched following custom functions list from cache` appears in the `error.log` file. 

![custom function with cache support](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-cache-error.png)

In case the custom functions are modified, the caching becomes invalidated, and it is parsed. 

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

* The user needs to ensure that the [core component and specification version is set to the latest version](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components/tree/release/650). However, for existing AEM projects and forms, there are additional steps to follow:

  * For the AEM project, the user should replace all instances of `submitForm('custom:submitSuccess', 'custom:submitError')` with `submitForm()` and deploy the project.

  * For existing forms, if the custom submission handlers are not functioning correctly, the user needs to open and save the `submitForm` rule on the **Submit** button using the Rule Editor. This action replaces the existing rule from `submitForm('custom:submitSuccess', 'custom:submitError')` with `submitForm()` in the form.


* If the JavaScript file containing code for custom functions has an error, the custom functions are not listed in the rule editor of an Adaptive Form. To check the custom function list, you can navigate to the `error.log` file for the error. In case of an error, the custom function list appears empty:

    ![error log file](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-list-error-file.png)

    In case of there is no error, the custom function are fetched and appear in the `error.log` file. A message as `Fetched following custom functions list` appears in the `error.log` file: 

    ![error log file with proper custom function](/help/forms/using/assets/custom-function-list-fetched-in-error.png)

## Considerations

* The `parameter type` and `return type` do not support `None`.

* The functions that are not supported in the custom function list are:
  * Generator functions
  * Async/Await functions 
  * Method definitions
  * Class methods
  * Default parameters
  * Rest parameters
