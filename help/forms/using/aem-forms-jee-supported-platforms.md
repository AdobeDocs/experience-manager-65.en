# Supported Platforms for AEM Forms on JEE {#supported-platforms-for-aem-forms-on-jee}

## Supported Platforms {#supported-platforms}

<div class="preview">

Adobe has released a [full installer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/forms-updates/aem-forms-releases.html) with AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 18 (6.5.18.0) on JEE along with the patch installers. The full installer supports new platforms while the patch installer includes only bug fixes.
If you are performing a fresh installation or planning to use latest software for your AEM 6.5 Forms on JEE environment, Adobe recommends using [AEM 6.5.18.0 Forms on JEE full installer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/forms-updates/aem-forms-releases.html) released on 31 August 2023 instead of AEM 6.5 Forms installer released on 08 April 2019 or AEM 6.5.12 Forms Installer released on 03 March 2022.

### Support levels {#support-levels}

AEM Forms on JEE server can be set up using any combination of supported operating systems, application servers, databases, database drivers, JDK, LDAP servers, and email servers.

This document lists the supported client and server platforms for AEM Forms on JEE. Adobe provides several levels of support, both for Adobe recommended configurations and for other configurations. The document also lists other supported software and their version, exceptions, patch definitions, and third-party software patch support policy.

>[!NOTE]
>
>- For a complete list of exceptions to supported server platforms, see [Exceptions to supported server platforms](../../forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md#p-exceptions-to-supported-server-platforms-p).
>- AEM Forms on JEE support only English, French, German, and Japanese versions of the supported operating systems and applications.

### Upgrade and Support policy
 
#### Full Installer

- **Upgrade Support for full installers**: A full installer is released with every sixth AEM Service Pack Release. For example, there was a full installer released with 6.5.12.0 and 6.5.18.0 SP releases. AEM Forms allows direct upgrades exclusively from the last two full installers. For example, AEM Forms facilitates direct upgrades to version 6.5.18.0 only from the last two full installers, namely 6.5.12.0 and 6.5.6.0. If you need to upgrade from an earlier upgrade, you can use a multi-hop upgrade to first go to a supported full installer release and then to the latest release. 

- **Deprecation and Removal**: The platform support is updated with each full installer release. Any software marked as deprecated in the platform matrix during a full installer release is entitled to be removed from the supported platform matrix in a subsequent full installer release, indicating the end of support for the software.
 
#### Service Packs

- **Service Pack Coverage**: Adobe provides technical support for AEM Forms environments using any of the latest six service packs. If your current version predates the last six service packs, Adobe strongly recommends upgrading to the latest version for optimal performance, security, and continuous support. 

- **Patch Installer Guidelines**: While using the patch installers to update, it's crucial to verify that the underlying full installer version is not more than two releases old. For instance, during the installation of service pack 6.5.19.0, ensure the underlying full installer version is either 6.5.18.0 or 6.5.12.0. 

- **Patch Upgrade Support**: You can keep upgrading to the latest service pack, until you are upgrading to the most recent supported platforms also. For example, upgrading from service pack 6.5.12.0 to 6.5.19.0 is possible, provided that you transition to a platform combination supported for 6.5.19.0.

### Recommended configurations {#recommendedconfigurations}

Adobe recommends these configurations and provides full or restricted support as part of the standard software maintenance agreement:

>[!NOTE]
>
>To help AEM Forms customers reduce the cost of ownership, simplify the deployment architecture, and modernize the development stack, Adobe Experience Manager enterprise platform is moving away from application server-based deployments in favor of standalone OSGi-based deployments. Adobe continues to support the AEM Forms JEE stack with a reduced matrix of infrastructure components.
>
>With the release of 6.5, infrastructure components that have the lowest usage among Adobe customers are no longer supported, as follows:
>
>- IBM&reg; DB2&reg; database
>- IBM&reg; AIX&reg; and Sun Solaris&trade; operating systems
>
>For new installations, where feasible it is recommended to deploy AEM Forms on the modern OSGi stack to use the latest innovations around responsive Adaptive Forms for mobile, multi-channel Interactive Communications, and backend data integrations using Form Data Model.
>
>Adobe recognizes that existing users must continue to deploy AEM Forms on JEE stack. In such scenarios, Adobe requires the deployment of AEM Forms JEE on supported infrastructure as described in this documentation. If you are upgrading to AEM 6.5 Forms and using a non-supported platform on the previous AEM Forms release, you can contact Adobe Support for help on upgrading to a supported platform.

### Java&trade; Virtual Machines (JVM) {#java-virtual-machines-jvm}

Adobe Experience Manager Forms requires a Java&trade; Virtual Machine to run, which is provided by the Java&trade; Development Kit (JDK) distribution. Adobe Experience Manager operates with the following versions of the Java&trade; Virtual Machines:

1. AEM Forms on JEE do not support any JDK with IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; other than IBM&reg; JDK.
1. CRX-repository supports persistence of type TarMK, MongoDB, and relational databases (RDBMK). You cannot have two different database systems between the application server and the CRX-repository. However, on an AEM Forms on JEE environment, you can use MongoMK with CRX-repository and a supported relational database with application server.
1. AEM Forms on JEE do not support WebSphere&reg; application server on CentOS.
1. AEM Forms on JEE do not support JBoss&reg; role-based access control (RBAC).
1. AEM Forms on JEE support Oracle Java&trade; SE 11 (64 bit) SDK for application server JBoss&reg; EAP 7.4 only.
1. JDK versions higher than 1.8.0_281 are not supported for WebLogic server. (FORMS-8498)
1. JDK 11.0.20 is not supported to install AEM Forms on JEE Installer. Only JDK 11.0.19 or earlier versions are supported to install AEM Forms on JEE Installer.

<!-- 
1. [!DNL Microsoft&reg; Windows Server 2019] does not support [!DNL MySQL 5.7] and [!DNL JBoss&reg; EAP 7.1], [!DNL Microsoft&reg; Windows Server 2019] does not support turnkey installations for [!DNL Experience Manager Forms Service Pack 6.5.10.0 and later]. (CQDOC-18312) 
-->

In addition, consider the following points while choosing software for Adobe AEM Forms on JEE deployments:

- AEM Forms on JEE support updates, patches, and fix packs on top of the specified major and minor version of supported software. However, update to the next major or minor version is not supported unless specified.
- Cluster-based installations do not support TarMK persistence. For information about supported persistence, see [Choosing a persistence type for an AEM Forms installation](/help/forms/using/choosing-persistence-type-for-aem-forms.md).
- AEM Forms on JEE support various third-party software as per Adobe's [Third-party software support Policy](../../forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md#p-third-party-patch-support-policy-p).
- AEM Forms on JEE support platforms as per the support provided by third-party vendors. Some combinations may not be allowed by third-party vendors. For example, many vendors have not certified their application servers with Oracle. As a result, AEM Forms on JEE also do not support these combinations. To ensure that you choose the supported software versions, check the support matrix for the third-party vendors as well.
- AEM Forms on JEE do not support TarMK Cold Standby.
- AEM Forms on JEE do not support vertical clustering.
- AEM Forms on JEE do not support MySQL database on a clustered environment.
- For the list of removed or updated platforms, see [AEM 6.5 Forms New Feature Summary](../../forms/using/whats-new.md) document.

### Exceptions to client support {#exceptions-to-client-support}

AEM Forms on JEE support updates, patches, and fix packs on top of the specified major and minor version of supported software. However, update to the next major or minor version is not supported unless specified.

## Third-party patch support policy {#third-party-patch-support-policy}

The third-party software requirements for AEM Forms on JEE are documented in the "System Requirements" section of their respective product documents. Access all documentation from [https://adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_documentation_65](https://adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_documentation_65) .

AEM Forms on JEE's third-party reference platforms state the specific patch level of third-party infrastructure that was current during the development and release of AEM Forms on JEE, and from the minimum patch/service pack level of the infrastructure supported by that version of AEM Forms on JEE.

Adobe supports urgent or recommended patches issued by third-party vendors upon their release assuming that third-party vendors guarantee backward compatibility with the versions that AEM Forms on JEE support. Adobe will only support patches released after the minimum patch level stated in the AEM Forms on JEE documentation.

Sometimes, Adobe does not support third-party updates that change major functionality, and thus do not support full backward compatibility. For details on the supported updates, see [Supported patch definitions](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/aem-forms-third-party-software-patch.html) for specific vendor products and the patch types Adobe supports.

Under circumstances beyond Adobe's control, third-party patches that claim backward compatibility may have negative impact on the Adobe products or customer environments. In such cases, Adobe recommends that customers assess the impact of any urgent patch from a third-party before applying them to critical systems. Adobe works with third parties using reasonable business efforts to resolve such issues, either through normal Adobe support programs or by third parties rectifying the issue in their patch. This does not guarantee that a newly released third-party patch that will be supported by Adobe works as documented by the vendor or with AEM Forms on JEE.

Adobe reserves the right to change the third-party reference platforms supported by a AEM Forms on JEE release and their supported patch definitions at any given point.

Additional information for third-party patches can also be found by searching the Adobe Enterprise Support site for knowledgebase articles related to your product.
