# We.Finance Auto Insurance Renewal reference site walkthrough{#we-finance-auto-insurance-renewal-reference-site-walkthrough}

## We.Finance Reference Site scenario  {#we-finance-reference-site-scenario}

We.Finance site is a financial services site designed to help you learn the interactive communications capabilities of AEM Forms.

Read a detailed walkthrough of a We.Finance Auto Insurance use case that showcases how AEM forms and its integration with Microsoft&reg; Dynamics helps personalize customer experience in a financial service company. The interactive walkthrough is designed to ease implementation of complex digital transactions and customer communication in a financial company.

**The journey starts with the use case:**

Sarah Rose is an existing We.Finance customer and has purchased an auto insurance policy. It is that time of the year for Sarah to renew her insurance policy. Gloria Rios is her insurance agent. We.Finance sends a reminder to Sarah about her policy renewal. Sarah follows the instructions provided in the email and successfully completes the process.

## Auto-Insurance application walkthrough {#auto-insurance-application-walkthrough}

The We.Finance Auto-Insurance application scenario is a visual narration for the user and is based on two personas:

* Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer
* Gloria Rios, Insurance Agent, We.Finance

### Gloria sends an Insurance policy renewal communication from We.Finance {#gloria-sends-an-insurance-policy-renewal-communication-from-we-finance}

Gloria logs into AEM instance, clicks **Auto Insurance Renewal,** and then clicks **Open Agent UI**. The click prefills the insurance document with policy details of Sarah Rose. Gloria clicks **Submit** and a message is displayed on the screen "Submission Initiated" and then in a few seconds "Submitted Successfully".

Sarah receives an email with the subject "Your Auto Insurance Renewal".
