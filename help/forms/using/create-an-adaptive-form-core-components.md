<!--**Applies to:** ✅ Adaptive Form Core Components ❎ [Adaptive Form Foundation Components](/help/forms/using/create-adaptive-form.md).-->

Adaptive Forms let you create forms that are engaging, responsive, dynamic, and adaptive. AEM Forms provide business user-friendly UI to quickly create Adaptive Forms. The UI offers quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an Adaptive Form. 

Before you start, learn about the type of Forms components available to you:

* [Adaptive Forms Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html?lang=en): These are standardized data capture components. These components provide customization capabilities, reduced development time, and lower maintenance costs for your digital enrollment experiences. A developer can easily customize and style these components. Adobe recommends using these modern and extensible components to develop Adaptive Forms.  

* [Adaptive Forms Foundation Components](creating-adaptive-form.md): These are classic (old) data capture components. You can continue to use these to edit your existing foundation components based Adaptive Form. If you are creating forms, Adobe recommends using  [Adaptive Forms Core Components](/help/forms/using/create-adaptive-form.md) to create an Adaptive Forms. 

## Pre-requisites

You require the following to create an Adaptive Form:

* **Enable Adaptive Forms Core Components for your environment**: AEM Archetype project version 41 or later is required to [enable Core Components for your environment](/help/forms/using/enable-adaptive-forms-core-components.md). On enabling the Core Components for your environment, the **Adaptive Forms (Core Component)** template and Canvas theme are added to your environment.     

* **An Adaptive Form template**: A template provides a basic structure and defines appearance (layouts and styles) of an Adaptive Form. It has pre-formatted components containing certain properties and content structure. It also provides the options to define a theme and a submit action. The theme defines the look and feel and submit action defines the action to take on submission of an Adaptive Form. You can also deploy [sample templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/sample-themes-templates-form-data-models-core-components.html) to your environment. These help you start creating forms swiftly.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > If you do not have, **Adaptive Forms (Core Component)** template on your environment, [Enable Adaptive Forms Core Components for your environment](/help/forms/using/enable-adaptive-forms-core-components.md). On enabling the Core Components for your environment, the **Adaptive Forms (Core Component)** template is added to your environment.

* **An Adaptive Form theme**: A theme contains styling details for the components and panels. Styles include properties such as background colors, state colors, transparency, alignment, and size. When you apply a theme, the specified style reflects on the corresponding components.  The `Canvas` theme is added by default, when you enable core components for your environment. You can  [download and customize the standard themes](create-or-customize-themes-for-adaptive-forms-core-components.md). For **out of the box** themes you can deploy [sample themes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/sample-themes-templates-form-data-models-core-components.html) to your environment. These help you start styling your forms and provide a base structure to create or customize a theme as per your business requirements.

* **Permissions**: Add your users to [!DNL forms-users] group. The members of the [!DNL forms-users] group have permissions to create an Adaptive Form. For detailed list of forms-specific user groups, see [Groups and permissions](forms-groups-privileges-tasks.md).

<!--
>[!NOTE]
>
>
> In addition to the given themes and templates when you enable Core Components, you can also deploy the latest out-of-the box [sample themes and templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/sample-themes-templates-form-data-models-core-components.html) to your AEM environment for use in Core Components based Adaptive Forms.

## Configure a pre-fill service  {#configure-prefill-service-for-form}

You can use the prefill service to auto fill fields of an Adaptive Form using existing data. When a user opens a form, the values for those fields are prefilled. You can:

* [Create a custom pre-fill service](/help/forms/using/prepopulate-adaptive-form-fields.md)
* [Use Form Data Model Prefill service](#fdm-prefill-service)

### Use Form Data Model Prefill service to prepopulate fields of an Adaptive Form {#fdm-prefill-service}

You can use the Form Data Model Prefill service to prepopulate fields of an Adaptive Form using a Form Data Model or a custom pre-fill service. The Form Data Model Prefill service uses the [Get Service of configured Form Data Model](work-with-form-data-model.md#add-data-model-objects-and-services-add-data-model-objects-and-services) to retrieve data. To use Form Data Model Prefill service for an Adaptive Form:
