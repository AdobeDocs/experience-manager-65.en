# Adding attachments{#adding-attachments}

## Adding attachments in forms synced with AEM Forms Workflow server (AEM Forms on JEE) {#adding-annotations}

AEM Forms app lets you attach images, scribbled notes, and text notes to your form synced with AEM Forms JEE server. If your form is loaded from an AEM Forms Workflow server, your attachments are added to the form. You can select the attachment button ![attachments-app](assets/attachments-app.png) to see all the attachments in a form together. The red notification specifies the number of attachments in the form. If there are no attachments in the form, you cannot see the red notifications button. If there are no attachments in the form, when you select the attachments button ![attch](assets/attch.png), you get options to attach photos or scribbles.

Your options are:

* **Gallery**: Lets you add a picture from the pictures saved on your device.

* **Camera**: Lets you take a picture and add it to the form.

* **Notes**: Lets you add a scribble or a text note. Use ![scribble](assets/scribble.png) to add a scribble, and ![keyboard](assets/keyboard.png) to add a text note.

## Attachments in forms synced with the AEM Forms servers without AEM Forms Workflow (AEM Forms on OSGi) {#attachments-in-forms-synced-with-the-aem-forms-servers-without-aem-forms-workflow-aem-forms-on-osgi}

Attachments for mobile forms synced with AEM Forms OSGi servers work similar to the AEM Forms JEE servers.

Form level attachments are not supported for adaptive forms loaded in the app from an AEM Forms OSGi server. To attach images or text notes, enable field level attachments in the form when you author it. Drag-drop the file attachment component from the components browser on the field.

If there are adaptive forms, you can view the attached files in the document of record (DoR). See, [Generate Document of Record for non-XFA adaptive forms](../../forms/using/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.md).
