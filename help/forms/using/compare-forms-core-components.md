<span class="preview"> This is a pre-release feature and accessible through our [pre-release channel](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/prerelease.html#new-features). </span>

When form authors need to compare two distinct forms based on the fields, content, and form components, they compare the two forms. The form author must make sure that the two forms are in the same directory or folder in order to compare them. To compare two distinct adaptive forms, perform the following steps:

1. Select adaptive forms and click **[!UICONTROL Compare]**.
