# Configuring AEM DS settings{#configuring-aem-ds-settings}

This article describes how to configure the **AEM DS Settings Service**. This setting can be used in multiple scenarios, for example:

* In Correspondence Management

    * For configuring AEM Forms Workflow
    * While using the Forms Portal for remote save of draft/submission

* In Adaptive forms, for cases when an Adaptive form is submitted from publish instance

Following are the steps to configure the **[!UICONTROL AEM DS Settings]**:

1. Open the Configuration Manager on the publish instance using the URL:   
   *https://localhost:port/system/console/configMgr*.
