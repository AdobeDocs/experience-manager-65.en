# Transaction Reports for AEM Forms {#transaction-reports-overview}

Transaction reports within AEM Forms allow you to monitor all transactions since a designated date on your AEM Forms deployment. This functionality is designed to get information about forms usage thereby assisting business stakeholders in gaining a profound understanding of their digital processing volumes. Transactions, in this context, encompass various activities such as:

* Submission of an adaptive form, an HTML5 Form, or a form set
* Rendition of a print or a web version of an interactive communication
* Submission and rendition of a document
* Conversion of a document from one file format to another
