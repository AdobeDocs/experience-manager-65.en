# Transaction Reporting for AEM Forms {#transaction-reports-overview}

Transaction report within AEM Forms allows you to monitor all transactions since a designated date on your AEM Forms deployment. This functionality is designed to get information about forms usage thereby assisting business stakeholders in gaining a profound understanding of their digital processing volumes. Transactions, in this context, encompass various activities such as:

* Submission of an adaptive form, an HTML5 Form, or a form set
* Rendition of a print or a web version of an interactive communication
* Submission and rendition of a Form
* Conversion of a document from one file format to another

You can refer to the following for comprehensive instructions on how to enable transactions, the list of billable APIs, and custom recorder implementations, based on your AEM Forms technology stack:
