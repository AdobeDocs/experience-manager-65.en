This solution applies to:
* AEM Forms on all (JBoss, Weblogic, Websphere) JEE servers
* AEM Forms on OSGi servers

## Solution

Download the [hotfix](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexperience.adobe.com%2F%23%2Fdownloads%2Fcontent%2Fsoftware-distribution%2Fen%2Faem.html%3Fpackage%3D%2Fcontent%2Fsoftware-distribution%2Fen%2Fdetails.html%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Faem%2Fpublic%2Fadobe%2Fpackages%2Fcq650%2Fhotfix%2FPaperCaptureSvc.zip&data=05%7C02%7Cruchitas%40adobe.com%7Cf50f80aab6994875271a08dc91f2f137%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C638545719814675925%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9pTrMfiMD%2B5kQezxsZwTdOmaaktxURR99d7f6wHr%2FWQ%3D&reserved=0) from the Software Distribution portal. 
1. Extract and copy the content of the downloaded folder.
1. Navigate to the paths below for the corresponding application servers:
    * **jboss**: 
  `..\Adobe\Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms\jboss\standalone\svcnative\PaperCaptureSvc`
    * **weblogic**: 
    `..\Adobe\Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms\crx-repository\bedrock\svcnative\PaperCaptureSvc`
    * **websphere**:      
    `..\Adobe\Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms\crx-repository\bedrock\svcnative\PaperCaptureSvc`
    * **OSGi setup**:  
    `..\quickstart\crx-quickstart\bedrock\svcnative\PaperCaptureSvc`
1. Stop the AEM application server.
1. Replace the existing contents of the `PaperCaptureSvc` folder with the copied content.
1. Restart the AEM application server.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > It is recommended to use the 'Ctrl + C' command to restart the SDK. Restarting the AEM SDK using alternative methods, for example, stopping Java processes, may lead to inconsistencies in the AEM development environment.
