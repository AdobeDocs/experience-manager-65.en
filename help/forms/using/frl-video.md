| Visual | Title | Speaker Script |

| Title screen with AEM Forms logo and FRL graphic | Introduction | Welcome to this tutorial on setting up Feature Restricted Licensing, or FRL, for Adobe Acrobat on your AEM Forms server. This process is essential as Adobe transitions away from perpetual licenses to the new FRL model. |
| Timeline showing EOL dates with arrows pointing to FRL transition | Background | Adobe Acrobat Classic versions with perpetual licenses are reaching their End of Life, requiring a transition to newer versions. AEM Forms PDF Generator relies on Adobe Acrobat for document conversion functionality. The Feature Restricted Licensing model provides the same functionality but with a modern licensing approach managed through the Adobe Admin Console. |
| Checklist of required items with checkboxes and icons | Prerequisites | Before we begin, let's ensure you have everything you need: First, Adobe Admin Console access with System Administrator privileges. Second, a user account with Deployment Administrator role in the Admin Console. Third, local administrator privileges on the server running AEM Forms. Fourth, a Windows 64-bit operating system on your AEM Forms server. Fifth, a stable internet connection for license activation. You should also have familiarity with the Adobe Admin Console interface and understand your AEM Forms deployment architecture. |
| Warning icon with backup graphic | Important Note | Remember to back up any custom Acrobat settings before starting, as you'll need to uninstall existing Acrobat installations during this process. |
| Flow diagram showing numbered steps from 1-7 | Process Overview | This process involves several key steps: preparing an FRL package in the Admin Console, granting download permissions, uninstalling previous Acrobat versions, installing the new Acrobat Pro, deploying the FRL package, and verifying the installation. Let's walk through each step. |
| Adobe Admin Console interface screenshot with Packages tab highlighted | Step 1: Admin Console Preparation | First, log in to the Adobe Admin Console with System Administrator privileges. Navigate to the Packages tab and select "Feature Restricted License." Click the "Get Started" button to begin creating your package. |
| Create Package configuration screen with settings highlighted | Package Configuration | Configure your package with these recommended settings: Select "Offline" for activation method, "PDF Generation" for entitlement, and "Windows 64-bit" for the platform. For app selection, keep only the License File in selected applications. Give your package a descriptive name like "Acrobat FRL AEM Forms" and create the package. |
| Admin Console Users tab with permissions dialog | Step 2: Grant Download Permissions | Next, you'll need to create or identify a user who will download the package. In the Admin Console, navigate to the Users tab, select your user, and assign them the "Deployment Administrator" role. This allows them to download the FRL package you created. |
| Windows Control Panel with Apps & Features showing Acrobat | Step 3: Uninstall Previous Acrobat | Before installing the new version, you must completely remove any existing Acrobat installations. Open the Windows Control Panel, navigate to Apps, locate Adobe Acrobat, and select Uninstall. For thorough removal, consider using the Adobe Acrobat Cleaner Tool, especially if you encounter issues later in the process. |
| Adobe Acrobat DC Downloads page with installer section highlighted | Step 4: Download and Install Adobe Acrobat Pro | After uninstalling, download the appropriate Acrobat Pro installer from the Adobe Acrobat DC Downloads page. For PDF Generator compatibility, the Windows 32-bit installer is recommended. |
| Installation process showing extraction and setup steps | Installation Process | Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder, locate Setup.exe, and run it as administrator. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installing, open Acrobat Pro once to dismiss any welcome dialogs, completing the initial setup. |
| Admin Console Packages tab with download button highlighted | Step 5: Download the FRL Package | Now, log in to the Adobe Admin Console using the account you granted download permissions to earlier. Navigate to the Packages tab, locate your FRL package, and download it to your AEM Forms server. |
| Command Prompt as Administrator with commands being typed | Step 6: Deploy the Package | Extract the downloaded package to a directory on your server. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and navigate to the extraction directory. |
| Command line showing the activation command with syntax highlighted | Activation Command | Run the activation command using this syntax: `adobe-licensing-toolkit.exe -p -i -f ngl-preconditioning-data.json`. Replace the JSON filename with the exact filename from your package. The command parameters are: -p for platform, -i to install the license, and -f to specify the JSON file path. When successful, you'll see the message "Operation Successfully Completed." |
| Table showing command parameters and descriptions | Command Parameters | The -p parameter specifies the platform and automatically detects the operating system. The -i parameter instructs the tool to install and activate the license. And the -f parameter specifies the path to the JSON license file. |
| AEM Forms admin interface showing PDF Generator service | Step 7: Test and Verify | Finally, test your installation by opening the AEM Forms admin interface and converting a simple document to PDF using the PDF Generator service. Also verify the Acrobat installation by opening Acrobat Pro, navigating to Help â†’ About, and confirming the version number and license status. |
| Split screen: Acrobat About dialog and successful PDF conversion | Verification | Check that the license shows as activated in Acrobat and that PDF Generator is able to successfully convert documents. |
| Common errors and solutions list with icons | Troubleshooting Tips | If you encounter issues, check these common problems: Ensure you're running Command Prompt as administrator, verify the JSON filename is correct, check for conflicting installations, and confirm your server has proper internet connectivity for activation. |
| Additional troubleshooting items with checkmarks | More Troubleshooting | Also check for firewall restrictions, corrupted packages, or conflicting Adobe IDs on the server. If all else fails, contact Adobe Support with detailed error messages. |
| Success screen with checkmark icon and contact information | Conclusion | You've now successfully set up Feature Restricted Licensing for Adobe Acrobat on your AEM Forms server. If you need additional assistance, contact Adobe Support or refer to the detailed documentation available on Experience League. |
