# Building a secure AEM Forms app for iOS {#building-a-secure-aem-forms-app-for-ios}

You need to archive the Xcode project for AEM Forms app to build the installer (an .ipa file) and a property list (a .plist file) file. The property list file contains configuration information of the hosted in-house app, such as the name and the hosting location of the app. For more information about property list file, see [About Information Property List Files](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/general/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html).

1. Log in to the following website:

   [https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle)

1. Create an App ID. For detailed steps to create an App ID, see [Creating and Configuring App IDs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html).
1. To configure the bundle identifier for the iOS application for your app, click **[!UICONTROL Configure App ID]**.
1. At the bottom of the web page, select **[!UICONTROL Enable for Data Protection]**. Specify the data protection options.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

1. Navigate to Provisioning>Distribution and create a New Profile using the App ID configured in step 3.
