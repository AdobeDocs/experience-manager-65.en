## Issue {#issue}

For AEM Forms on JEE that uses a relational database, time on the machine hosting AEM Forms and relational database should always be in absolute sync. If the time on these machines gets out of sync, the CRX-repository of AEM Forms on JEE server can become inaccessible. It may appear corrupt and become inaccessible via URL. The `AuthenticationsupportService missing` error is logged.
