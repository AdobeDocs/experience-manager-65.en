# Minification of the JavaScript files {#minification-of-the-javascript-files}

Minification removes from the source code the redundant characters, such as white space, new line, and comments. This improves the performance by reducing the size of the code. While minification does not impact the functionality, it reduces the readability of the code.

To generate minified code for semantic changes follow these steps.

1. Copy `client-html/src/main/webapp/js` from src-package on filesystem.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >See [Introduction to Customizing AEM Forms workspace](/help/forms/using/introduction-customizing-html-workspace.md) for more details about the packages.

1. Update paths in `main.js` located under client-html/src/main/webapp/js, for added/updated models/views.

   For example, addition of a new Sharequeue model, say mySharequeue, change:

   ```javascript
   sharequeuemodel : pathprefix + 'runtime/models/sharequeue',

   ```

   To

   ```javascript

   sharequeuemodel : pathprefix + 'runtime/myModels/mySharequeue',
   ```

1. Update `registry-config.xml, located at client-html/src/main/webapp/js/resource_generator,` in case there is change/addition of alias in `main.js`.

   For example, addition of a new Sharequeue model, say mySharequeue, change:

   ```xml
   <sharequeue
               name="sharequeue"
               path="runtime/models/sharequeue.js"
               service="service"/>

   ```

   To

   ```xml

   <sharequeue
               name="sharequeue"
               path="runtime/myModels/mySharequeue.js"
               service="service"/>
   ```

1. At client-html/src/main/webapp/js/minifier, run command:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

   It generates a folder minified-files, under client-html/src/main/webapp/js with minified main.js and registry.js.
