# Separator component in adaptive forms{#separator-component-in-adaptive-forms}

<span class="preview"> Adobe recommends using the modern and extensible data capture [Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html) for [creating new Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using/create-an-adaptive-form-core-components.md) or [adding Adaptive Forms to AEM Sites pages](/help/forms/using/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md). These components represent a significant advancement in Adaptive Forms creation, ensuring impressive user experiences. This article describes an older approach to authoring Adaptive Forms using foundation components. </span>

You can use the separator component to visually segregate panels of a form. You can define the overall appearance and style of a separator component by specifying the following properties of the separator component:

* **Element Name:** Specifies the name of the component. The SOM expressions address the component with a value specified in the Element Name field.
* **Thickness:** Specifies the thickness of the separator component in pixels.

* **CSS Class:** Specifies the custom CSS class for the separator component  

* **Inline styles:** With AEM Forms, you can now apply inline CSS styles to individual adaptive form components and preview the changes in real-time.

You can use the Layout mode to define the number of columns that the separator component spans to. For more information, see [Use Layout mode to resize components](../../forms/using/resize-using-layout-mode.md).

To specify the properties of a separator component:

1. Select a separator component and select ![cmppr](assets/cmppr.png). The properties open in the sidebar.
1. Click a tab in the Inline CSS Properties section so you can specify CSS properties. For example: a. In the Field tab, click **Add Item**. A row with two fields gets added.
1. In the first field from the left, specify a CSS3 property you want to apply. For example, **border**. You can also select a property by clicking the down-arrow button. The drop-down list is not exhaustive and you can specify any supported CSS3 property name in this field.
1. In the adjoining field, specify a valid value for the specified CSS3 property. For example, **3-px solid black**.
1. Click **Add Item** to specify another property and its value.
1. Click **Preview** so you can preview the changes in the form.
1. Click **OK** if you want to confirm the changes or **Cancel** to exit the dialog without any changes.
