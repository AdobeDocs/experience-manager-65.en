# Introduction to best accessibility practices in Forms Designer

An accessible form is one that almost everyone can use, including those who may have disabilities that affect how they are able to interact with the form on the computer screen. Users with visual impairments or reduced mobility, for example, are still able to use accessible forms.

Adobe LiveCycle Designer includes a number of features and capabilities that enhance the usability of forms for users with various disabilities, and that assist form authors in creating PDF forms that are more accessible to people with disabilities.

Building accessibility into forms not only allows the widest possible audience for content, it is a requirement when supplying documents in regions where compliance with accessibility standards is mandated. In the United States, for example, accessibility standards such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act exist to ensure that information technology is available to all users, including government employees with disabilities and members of the public with disabilities that consume government services.

LiveCycle Designer helps developers comply with the requirements mandated by accessibility standards. Its component-based approach enables form builders to take advantage of built-in accessibility features. LiveCycle Designer also provides support for creating accessible XHTML files (using LiveCycle Forms) and PDF forms. Accessible PDF forms include a complete logical structure plus additional information about a document’s contents to increase accessibility.
