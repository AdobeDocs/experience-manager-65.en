# Importing and exporting assets to AEM Forms{#importing-and-exporting-assets-to-aem-forms}

You can move forms and related assets, themes, data dictionaries, document fragments, and letters between different AEM Forms instances. Such a movement is required when migrating systems or moving forms from a stage server to a production server. For those assets for which upload and import via the AEM Forms UI is supported, using the Forms UI is the recommended way for export or import. Using AEM Package Manager for exporting or importing such assets is not recommended.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* In AEM 6.4 Forms, the structure and paths of crx-repository has changed. If you import assets from a previous version to AEM 6.4 Forms and the form has some dependencies on the older structure, you have to manually export the dependencies. For details of changes in the structure and paths of the repository, see [Repository Restructuring in AEM](/help/sites-deploying/repository-restructuring.md).

## Download or upload Forms &amp; Documents assets {#download-or-upload-forms-amp-documents-assets}

AEM Forms user interface lets you export assets from an AEM instance by downloading them as an AEM CRX-package or binary files. You can then import the downloaded AEM CRX-package or the binary file into another AEM instance.

Export and import via AEM Forms user interface is supported for all assets except for Adaptive Form templates and Adaptive Form content policies. Therefore, on exporting an adaptive form from AEM Forms UI, the related adaptive form template and content policies are not automatically exported like other related assets.

For these asset types, you must use AEM Package Manager to create a CRX package on the source AEM server and install the package on the destination server. For information about creating and installing packages, see [Working with packages](/help/sites-administering/package-manager.md).

### Download Forms &amp; Documents assets {#download-forms-amp-documents-assets}

To download Forms & Documents assets:

1. Log in to the AEM Forms instance.
1. Select Experience Manager ![adobeexperiencemanager](assets/adobeexperiencemanager.png) icon &gt; navigation ![compass](assets/compass.png) icon&gt; Forms &gt; Forms & Documents.
1. Select the forms assets and select the **Download** icon.
1. In the Download Asset(s), choose one of the following options, and select **Download**.

    * **Download as CRX Package:** Use the option to download and move all selected assets and related dependencies from an AEM Forms instance to another. It downloads all assets and folders as crx package. Any form assets including the forms authored in AEM (adaptive forms, Interactive Communications, and adaptive form fragments), form sets, form templates, PDF documents, and resources (XSDs, XFS, images) can be downloaded as package from AEM Forms UI.
      The advantage of downloading assets as package is that it also downloads assets that have been used by the asset selected to download. For example, If you have an adaptive form which uses a form template, XSD, and an image. When you select this adaptive form and download it as package, the downloaded package also contains the form template, XSD, and the image. All the metadata properties (including custom properties) associated with the asset are also downloaded.

    * **Download asset(s) as binary files:** Use the option to download only form templates (XDP), PDF forms (PDF), document (PDF), and resources (images, schemas, stylesheets). You can edit these assets with external applications. It downloads the forms assets that have binaries, such as XSDs, XDPs, images, PDFs, and XDPs as a .zip file.
      You cannot download adaptive forms, Interactive Communications, adaptive form fragments, themes, and form sets with **Download asset(s) as binary files** option. To download these assets, you should use **Download as CRX Package** option.

   The selected assets are downloaded as an archive (.zip file).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Both AEM package and binary files are downloaded as an archive (.zip file). The templates for the assets do not get downloaded along with the assets. You need to export the asset templates separately.

### Upload Forms &amp; Documents assets {#upload-forms-amp-documents-assets}

To upload Forms & Documents assets:

<!--[!VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/)-->

1. Log in to the AEM Forms instance.
1. Select Experience Manager ![adobeexperiencemanager](assets/adobeexperiencemanager.png) icon &gt; navigation ![compass](assets/compass.png) icon&gt; Forms&gt; Forms & Documents.
1. Select **Create** &gt;**File Upload**. An upload forms or package dialog appears.

   On the dialog box, verify the details of assets being uploaded, and select **Upload**.

   In case, you upload an existing forms asset, the asset gets updated.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Uploading a package does not replace existing folder hierarchy. For example, If you have an adaptive form named 'Training' at location /content/dam/formsanddocuments on one server. You download the adaptive form and upload the form on another server. The second server also has a folder with name 'Training' at the same location /content/dam/formsanddocuments. The upload fails.

## Downloading or uploading a theme {#downloading-or-uploading-a-theme}

With AEM Forms, you can create, download, or upload themes. A theme is created like other assets such as forms, documents, and letters.

1. To download the .cmp file, select **OK**.
1. Correspondence Management downloads a .cmp file to your computer.

   The .cmp file includes the exported assets. You can share the .cmp file with others. Other users can import the .cmp file in a different server to get all the assets in the new server.

### Export all the Correspondence Management assets as a package {#export-all-the-correspondence-management-assets-as-a-package}

Use this option to download all the Correspondence Management assets and related dependencies as a package from an AEM forms instance.

For example, if Correspondence Management has a letter that uses an image and text, the downloaded package also contains the image and the text related to the letter. All the metadata properties (including custom properties) associated with the asset are also downloaded. Once you have downloaded the package (.cmp), you can [import the package to a different AEM Forms instance](../../forms/using/import-export-forms-templates.md#p-upload-forms-documents-assets-p).

To download all the Correspondence Management assets and related dependencies as a package, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to AEM Forms server as a forms user.

## Folders and organizing assets {#folders-and-organizing-assets}

AEM Forms user interface uses folders to arrange assets. These folders are used for arranging assets created within AEM Forms user interface. You can rename, create subfolders, and store assets and documents in these folders. Organizing documents and assets in a folder let you group the files together for easy management. You can select a folder and choose to download or delete it.

To create a folder, complete the following steps:

### Create a folder {#create-a-folder}

1. Log in to the AEM Forms user interface at `https://<server>:<port>/aem/forms.html`.
1. Navigate to the location under which you want to create a folder.
1. Select Create &gt; Folder.
1. Enter the following details:

    * **Title:** Display name for the folder
    * **Name:** *(Mandatory)* The node name under which you want to store the folder in the repository

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >By default, the value of name field is automatically populated from the title. The name can only contain alphanumeric characters, or the hyphen (-) and underscore (_) special characters. Any other special characters entered in the title are automatically replaced with a hyphen and you are prompted to confirm the new name. You can choose to continue with suggested name or edit it further.

1. A new folder with the title you defined is displayed at the current location in the asset listing.

   If a folder exists with the name specified, the submission fails with an error. You can view the error message by hovering over the error ![aem6forms_error_alert](assets/aem6forms_error_alert.png) icon that appears beside the name field.

   You can select the newly created folder to go inside the folder and create assets or folders within the folder. Further, you can select a folder and choose to queue it for download, delete it, or edit its name.
