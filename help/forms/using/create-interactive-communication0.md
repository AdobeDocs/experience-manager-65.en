# Tutorial: Create Interactive Communication {#tutorial-create-interactive-communication}

 ![09-style-your-adaptive-form-small](assets/09-style-your-adaptive-form-small.png)

This tutorial is a step in the [Create your first Interactive Communication](/help/forms/using/create-your-first-interactive-communication.md) series. It is recommended to follow the series in chronological sequence to understand, perform, and demonstrate the complete tutorial use case.

Once you have created all the building blocks such as form data model, document fragments, templates, and themes for the web version, you can start creating an Interactive Communication.

Interactive Communications can be delivered through two channels: Print and Web. You can also create an Interactive Communication with Print channel as the master. Print as master option for Web channel ensures the content, inheritance, and data binding of the Web channel is derived from the Print channel. It also ensures that the changes made in the Print channel are synchronized in the Web channel. The Interactive Communication authors are, however, allowed to break the inheritance for specific components in the Web channel.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create interactive communications for Print and Web channels. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Create Interactive Communication for the Print channel
* Create Interactive Communication for the Web channel
* Create Print and Web Interactive Communications with Print as Master

## Create Interactive Communications for Print and Web with auto synchronization {#create-interactive-communications-for-print-and-web-with-auto-synchronization}

You can also create an Interactive Communication by enabling auto synchronization between Print and Web channels. To enable auto synchronization, select the Print as master option while creating the Interactive Communication. Selecting the Print as master option ensures the content, inheritance, and data binding of the Web channel is derived from the Print channel. It also ensures that the changes made in the Print channel are reflected in the Web channel.

Execute the following steps to derive the Web channel content using Print channel:

1. Log in to the AEM author instance and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Forms]** &gt; **[!UICONTROL Forms & Documents]**.
1. Select **Create** and select **Interactive Communication**. The **Create Interactive Communication** wizard is displayed.
1. Specify **create_first_ic** in the **Title** and the **Name** field. Select **FDM_Create_First_IC** as the Form Data Model and select **Next**.
1. In the **Channels** wizard:

    1. Specify **create_first_ic_print_template** as the Print template and select **Select**.

    1. Select the **Use Print as Master for Web Channel** checkbox.
    1. Specify **Create_First_IC_templates** folder &gt; **Create_First_IC_Web_Template** as the Web template and select **Select**.

    1. Select **Create**.

   A confirmation message is displayed that the Interactive Communication has been created successfully.

1. Select **Edit** to open the Interactive Communication in the right pane.
1. Execute steps 6 - 15 of [Create Interactive Communication for Print channel](../../forms/using/create-interactive-communication0.md#create-interactive-communication-for-print-channel) section.
1. Select the **Channels** tab from the left pane and select **Web** to auto-generate content for the Web channel from the Print channel.
1. As the **Use Print as Master for Web Channel** checkbox is selected in step 4, the content and bindings are auto-generated for Web channel from the Print channel.

   The print channel content is inserted below the Web channel template content. To modify the Web channel content that has been auto-generated from the Print channel, you can cancel the inheritance for any target area.

   Hover over the relevant target area in the web channel and select ![cancelinheritance](assets/cancelinheritance.png) (Cancel Inheritance) and then in the **Cancel Inheritance** dialog, select **Yes**.

   ![Cancel inheritance](assets/cancel_inheritance_web_channel_new.png)

   If you have canceled inheritance of a component, you can re-enable it. To re-enable inheritance, hover over the boundary of the relevant target area, which includes the component, and select ![reenableinheritance](assets/reenableinheritance.png).

1. Select the **Content** tab in the left pane.
1. Drag-and-drop the auto-generated Web channel content to the existing panels in the Web template using the content tree. The following is the list of components that need to be rearranged:

    * Bill Details component to Bill Details panel
    * Customer Details component to Customer Details panel
    * Bill Summary component to Bill Summary panel
    * Summary of Charges component to Summary of Charges panel
    * Layout fragment (table) to the Itemised Calls panel

   ![Web content tree](assets/ic_web_content_tree_new.png)

1. Repeat steps 13 - 18 of [Create Interactive Communication for Web channel](../../forms/using/create-interactive-communication0.md#create-interactive-communication-for-web-channel) to insert the **Pay Now** and **Subscribe** hyperlinks in the Web channel of the Interactive Communication.
