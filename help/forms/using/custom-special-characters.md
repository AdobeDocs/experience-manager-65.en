# Custom special characters in Correspondence Management{#custom-special-characters-in-correspondence-management}

## Overview {#overview}

Correspondence Management has built-in default support for 210 special characters that you can insert in letters with ease.

For example, you can insert the following special characters:

* Currency symbols such as &euro;,￥, and £
* Mathematical symbols such as ∑, √, ∂, and ^
* Punctuation symbols as ‟ and "

You can insert special characters in letters:

* In the [text editor](/help/forms/using/document-fragments.md#createtext)
* In an [editable, inline module in a correspondence](../../forms/using/create-correspondence.md#managecontent)

The admin can add support for more/custom special characters by customization. This article provides the instructions on how you can add support for additional, custom special characters.

## Add or modify support for custom special characters in Correspondence Management {#creatingfolderstructure}

Use the following steps to add support for custom special characters:

1. Go to `https://'[server]:[port]'/[ContextPath]/crx/de` and login as Administrator.
1. In the apps folder, create a folder named **[!UICONTROL specialcharacters]** with path/structure similar to the specialcharacters folder (in the textEditorConfig folder under libs):

    1. Right-click the **specialcharacters** folder at the following path and select **Overlay Node**:

       `/libs/fd/cm/ma/gui/configuration/textEditorConfig/specialcharacters`

    1. Ensure that the Overlay Node dialog has the following values:

       **Path:** /libs/fd/cm/ma/gui/configuration/textEditorConfig/specialcharacters

       **Overlay Location:** /apps/

       **Match Node Types:** Checked

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >Do not change the /libs branch. Any changes you do make may be lost, because this branch is liable to change whenever you:
       >
       >
       >
       >    * Upgrade on your instance
       >    * Apply a hot fix
       >    * Install a feature pack
       >
       >

    1. Click **OK** and then click **Save All**. The specialcharacters folder is created in the specified path.

       After creating the overlay, verify the node structure tags. Each node created in /apps using the overlay should have the same class and properties as defined in /libs for that node. If any property or tag is missing in the node structure under /apps location, sync its tags with the corresponding node in /libs.

1. Ensure that the **[!UICONTROL textEditorConfig]** node has the following properties and values:

   | Name |Type |Value |
   |---|---|---|
   | cmConfigurationType |String |cmTextEditorConfiguration |
   | cssPath |String |/libs/fd/cm/ma/gui/components/admin/createasset/textcontrol/clientlibs/textcontrol |

1. Right-click the **[!UICONTROL specialcharacters]** folder at the following path and select **Create &gt; Child Node** and then click **Save All**:

   /apps/fd/cm/ma/gui/configuration/textEditorConfig/specialcharacters/&lt;YourChildNode&gt;

1. Refresh the Text Editor\Create Correspondence UI page. The node that you have added is the last one in the list of Special characters in the UI.
1. Click **Save All**.
1. Changes in the special characters as required:
