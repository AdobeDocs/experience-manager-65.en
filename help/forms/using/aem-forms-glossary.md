## AEM Forms Add-On Package

An application deployed into Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a package, containing services (API providers) and servlets or JSPs managed by the AEM Sling framework.

## AEM Forms on JEE

A deployment option of AEM Forms that leverages Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) servers, providing enterprise-level scalability, transaction management, and support for complex enterprise workflows.

## AEM Forms on OSGi

AEM Forms on OSGi environment is standard AEM Author or AEM Publish with AEM Forms package deployed on it. You can run AEM Forms on OSGi in a single server environment, Farm, and clustered setups. Cluster setup is available only for AEM Author instances.

## AEM Forms Workbench

A desktop application for creating, editing, and deploying workflows, as well as managing form-centric business processes. It provides integration with back-end services and systems.

## Archetype

A template or pattern in AEM used to generate a new project with a predefined structure, facilitating standardization, quick setup, and adherence to AEM development best practices.

## Asset Sharing

The ability to share and reuse digital assets like images, documents, and fragments across forms and templates to maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

## Author Instance

The environment where content creators and administrators design, create, and manage content before publishing it. Supports versioning, previewing, and testing.

## Authoring Frontend

A user interface for authoring and managing forms within AEM Forms.

## Core AEM Services

Fundamental services provided by AEM to deployed applications, including a JCR-compliant content repository, an OSGi service container, a workflow engine, a trust store, and a key store.

## Core Components

Out-of-the-box reusable building blocks for creating content, including form fields, layout containers, buttons, and other interactive elements.

## Correspondence Management

A module that enables businesses to create, manage, and deliver personalized correspondence using predefined templates, rules, and data sources. Includes letter templates, customer communications, and batch generation.

## CRX (Content Repository Extreme)

The built-in Java Content Repository (JCR) in AEM that stores structured and unstructured data, enabling hierarchical storage of content, templates, and configurations.

## Custom XCI (Cross-Channel Interactive Communication)

A custom implementation for managing highly personalized, multichannel communications. It combines data from various sources, like CRM or ERP systems, to deliver communications across formats such as web, mobile, email, and print. Custom XCI extends standard XCI features with additional capabilities tailored for specific organizational needs.

## Data Integration

Seamless integration of external data sources, such as databases, web services, or REST APIs, into forms and workflows to enable dynamic and personalized user experiences.

## Dispatcher

A caching and load balancing tool used in AEM to enhance website performance and security by caching responses, distributing load, and protecting against DoS attacks.

## Document Fragments

Reusable components of documents, such as headers, footers, disclaimers, or clauses, which can be dynamically included in forms or correspondence to ensure consistency.

## Document of Record (DoR)

A feature in AEM Forms that generates a non-editable, archival version of a submitted form, typically in PDF format, preserving the exact content and layout as a record of the transaction.

## Form Data Model (FDM)

A representation layer that connects adaptive forms to backend data sources, enabling integration with RESTful web services, SOAP services, and OData. FDM allows form authors to map form fields directly to backend data structures, ensuring seamless synchronization of user input with external systems.

## Form Localization

The process of adapting forms to support multiple languages and regional settings, ensuring that forms are accessible and user-friendly to a diverse audience.

## Form Portal

A customizable interface in AEM Forms that allows users to discover, access, and submit forms efficiently across web and mobile platforms.

## Form Rendition and Submission Frontend

An end-user interface in AEM Forms that allows users to view and submit forms via a web browser.

## Form Sets

A collection of related forms grouped together to be presented as a single entity to users, allowing for complex data collection processes to be broken down into manageable sections.

## Forms Designer

A stand-alone application used to design forms such as Document of Record (DoR), PDF Forms, and HTML5 Forms, which can be uploaded to AEM Forms Manager.

## Forms Services

Functionalities within AEM Forms that enable the creation, assembly, distribution, and archiving of PDF documents, addition of digital signatures, and decoding of barcoded forms.

## Forms Workspace

A mobile application that extends digital business processes to mobile devices, allowing users to collect and record data even when offline. It leverages device capabilities to capture photos, videos, timestamps, and other information, synchronizing the data when the device reconnects to a network.

## JCR (Java Content Repository)

A hierarchical, standards-based repository for storing content, configurations, and metadata in AEM, supporting structured and unstructured data storage.

## LiveCycle

An earlier version of AEM Forms, with legacy features for form and document automation, some of which are integrated into the AEM Forms platform.

## OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative)

A modular framework used in AEM for managing Java components, enabling dynamic configuration and deployment of services.

## PDF Generator

A tool in AEM Forms that converts various file formats (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) into PDF documents and provides features like encryption, watermarking, and merging.

## Publish Instance

The environment in AEM that serves live content to end-users. It delivers forms, pages, and other digital experiences with optimized performance.

## REST APIs

APIs provided by AEM Forms' web layer for remote consumption by HTTP-based clients, such as the forms mobile SDK.

## Rule Editor

A visual tool in Adaptive Forms that allows authors to define custom rules and logic for form fields, such as visibility, validation, and data prepopulation, without requiring coding expertise.

## Scribble Signatures

A feature in AEM Forms that allows users to electronically sign forms by drawing their signature directly on the form using a mouse or touch-enabled device.

## Sling

A REST-based web framework used in AEM to map request URLs to content resources, enabling efficient content rendering and delivery.

## Web Layer

Comprises JSPs or servlets built over common and forms services, providing functionalities such as authoring front-end, form rendition and submission front-end, and REST APIs.

## Workflow

A set of automated or manual steps in AEM Forms that manage business processes, such as document approval, content publishing, or user notifications.
