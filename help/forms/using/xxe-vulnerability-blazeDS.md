# XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability in BlazeDS

| Also applies to AEM Forms on JEE, Digital Enterprise Platform |

Adobe has been notified of an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability (CVE-2015-3269) in BlazeDS. To fix the vulnerability retrospectively in BlazeDS distributions embedded in LiveCycle Data Services (LCDS), Adobe has released a patch that includes fixes in the flex-messaging-core.jar file.

Perform the following steps to obtain and apply the patch:

1. Patches are available for the following LCDS versions. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://chl-author-preview.corp.adobe.com/content/help/en/security/products/livecycleds/apsb15-20.html) for more information and to download the patch for your LCDS version.

    * LCDS 3.0.0.354170
    * LCDS 3.1.0.354173
    * LCDS 4.5.1.354169
    * LCDS 4.6.2.354169
    * LCDS 4.7.0.354169

1. Navigate to the patch directory and copy the flex-messaging-core.jar file.

1. Replace the flex-messaging-core.jar file in your LCDS application with the file copied in step 2.

1. Edit the services-config.xml file in your LCDS application to specify the value of the allow-xml-external-entity-expansion property as false. The default value is true.

    Also, add the property at channels/channel-definition/properties/serialization. For example:

    ```
    |<services-config..>

    |

    ---- <channels..>

        |

        ---- <channel-definition ...>

            |

            ---- <properties>

                |

                ---- <serialization>

                    |

                    ---- <allow-xml-external-entity-expansion>
                            false
                        </allow-xml-external-entity-expansion>
    ```   

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The default value true maintains backward compatibility and must be turned off to configure the XML parser to disable entity expansion as explained in XML External Entity (XXE) Processing.

>[!NOTE]
>
>After applying the patch, if you encounter the following error, It implies that your XML parser does not support the external-general-entities feature. Therefore, you need to update your XML parser such as Xerces 2.9.1.

```Error deserializing XML type jaxp_feature_not_supported: Feature "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" is not supported```
