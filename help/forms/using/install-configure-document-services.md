# Installing and configuring document services {#installing-and-configuring-document-services}

AEM Forms provides a set of OSGi services to accomplish different document level operations, for example, services to create, assemble, distribute, and archive PDF documents, add digital signatures to limit access to documents, and decode Barcoded Forms. These services are included in AEM Forms add-on package. Collectively, these services are known as document services. The list of available document services and their major capabilities is as below:

* **Assembler service:** Enables you to combine, rearrange, and augment PDF and XDP documents and obtain information about PDF documents. It also helps convert and validate PDF documents to PDF/A standard, transforms PDF forms, XML forms, and PDF forms to PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2b, and PDFA/A-3b. For more information, see [Assembler Service](/help/forms/using/assembler-service.md).

* **ConvertPDF service:** Enables you to convert PDF documents to PostScript or image files (JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, and TIFF). For more information, see [ConvertPDF Service](/help/forms/using/using-convertpdf-service.md).

* **Barcoded Forms service:** Enables you to extract data from electronic images of barcodes. The service accepts TIFF and PDF files that include one or more barcodes as input and extracts the barcode data. For more information, see [Barcoded Forms Service](/help/forms/using/using-barcoded-forms-service.md).

* **DocAssurance service:** Enables you to encrypt and decrypt documents, extend the functionality of Adobe Reader with additional usage rights, and add digital signatures to your documents. The Doc Assurance service contains three services: signature, encryption, and reader extension. For more information, see [DocAssurance Service](/help/forms/using/overview-aem-document-services.md).

* **Encryption service:** Enables you to encrypt and decrypt documents. When a document is encrypted, its contents become unreadable. An authorized user can decrypt the document to obtain access to its contents. For more information, see [Encryption Service](/help/forms/using/overview-aem-document-services.md#encryption-service).

* **Forms service:** Lets you create interactive data capture client applications that validate, process, transform, and deliver forms that are typically created in Forms Designer. The Forms service renders any form design that you develop to PDF documents. For more information, see [Forms Service](/help/forms/using/forms-service.md).

* **Output service:** Enables you to create documents in different formats, including PDF, laser printer formats, and label printer formats. Laser printer formats are PostScript and Printer Control Language (PCL). For more information, see [Output Service](/help/forms/using/output-service.md).

* **PDF Generator service:** The PDF Generator service provides APIs to converts native file formats to PDF. It also converts PDF to other file formats and optimizes the size of PDF documents. For more information, see [PDF Generator Service](aem-document-services-programmatically.md#pdfgeneratorservice).

* **Reader Extension service:** Enables your organization to easily share interactive PDF documents by extending the functionality of Adobe Reader with additional usage rights. The service activates features that are not available when a PDF document is opened using Adobe Reader, such as adding comments to a document, filling forms, and saving the document. For more information, see [Reader Extension Service](/help/forms/using/overview-aem-document-services.md#reader-extension-service).

* **Signature service:** Lets you work with digital signatures and documents on the AEM server. For example, the Signature service is typically used in the following situations:

  * The AEM server certifies a form before it is sent to a user to open by using Acrobat or Adobe Reader.
  * The AEM server validates a signature that was added to a form by using Acrobat or Adobe Reader.
  * The AEM server signs a form on behalf of a public notary.

   The signature service accesses certificates and credentials that are stored in the trust store. For more information, see [Signature Service](/help/forms/using/aem-document-services-programmatically.md).

AEM Forms is a powerful enterprise-class platform and the document services is only one of the capability of AEM Forms. For the complete list of capabilities, see [Introduction to AEM Forms](/help/forms/using/introduction-aem-forms.md).

## Deployment Topology {#deployment-topology}

AEM Forms add-on package is an application deployed onto AEM. Generally, you require only one AEM instance (author or publish) to run AEM Forms document services. The following topology is recommended to run AEM Forms document services. For detailed information about topologies, see [Architecture and deployment topologies for AEM Forms](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-architecture-deployment.md).

![Architecture and deployment topologies for AEM Forms](do-not-localize/document-services.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although AEM Forms lets you set up and run all the functionalities from a single server, you should do capacity planning, load balancing, and set up dedicated servers for specific capabilities in a production environment. For example, for an environment using the PDF Generator service to convert thousands of pages a day and multiple adaptive forms to capture data, set up separate AEM Forms servers for the PDF Generator service and adaptive forms capabilities. It helps provide optimum performance and scale the servers independent of each other.

## System Requirements {#system-requirements}

Before you begin to install and configure AEM Forms document services, ensure that:

* Hardware and software infrastructure is in place. For a detailed list of supported hardware and software, see [technical requirements](/help/sites-deploying/technical-requirements.md).  

* Installation path of the AEM instance does not contain white-spaces.
* An AEM instance is up and running. In AEM terminology, an "instance" is a copy of AEM running on a server in the author or publish mode. Generally, you require only one AEM instance (author or publish) to run AEM Forms document services:

  * **Author**: An AEM instance used to create, upload, and edit content and to administer the website. Once content is ready to go live, it is replicated to the publish instance.
  * **Publish**: An AEM instance that serves the published content to the public over the internet or an internal network.

* Memory requirements are met. AEM Forms add-on package requires:

  * 15 GB of temporary space for Microsoft&reg; Windows-based installations.
  * 6 GB of temporary space for UNIX-based installations.

* Client software required for PDF generator to perform conversion on Microsoft&reg; Windows and Linux&reg; are installed:

  * **Microsoft&reg; Windows**: Install [Microsoft&reg; Office](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md#p-software-support-for-pdf-generator-p) or [Apache OpenOffice](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md#software-support-for-pdf-generator)
  * **Linux&reg;**: Install [Apache OpenOffice](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-jee-supported-platforms.md#p-software-support-for-pdf-generator-p)

>[!NOTE]
>
>* On Microsoft&reg; Windows, PDF Generator supports WebKit, Acrobat WebCapture, and WebToPDF conversion routes to convert HTML files to PDF documents.
>* On UNIX-based operating systems, PDF Generator supports WebKit and WebToPDF conversion routes to convert HTML files to PDF documents.

## Pre-installation configurations {#preinstallationconfigurations}

Configurations listed in the pre-installation configurations section are applicable only to the PDF Generator service. If you are not configuring the PDF Generator service, you can skip the pre-installation configuration section.

### Install Adobe Acrobat and third-party applications {#install-adobe-acrobat-and-third-party-applications}

If you are going use the PDF Generator service to convert native file formats such as Microsoft&reg; Word, Microsoft&reg; Excel, Microsoft&reg; PowerPoint, OpenOffice, WordPerfect X7, and Adobe Acrobat to PDF Documents, ensure that these applications are installed on the AEM Forms Server.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* If your AEM Forms Server is in an offline or secure environment and internet is not available to activate Adobe Acrobat, see [Offline Activation](https://exception.licenses.adobe.com/aoes/aoes/v1/t1?locale=en) for instructions to activate such instances of Adobe Acrobat.
>* Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft&reg; Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are available only for Microsoft&reg; Windows. If you are using the UNIX-based operating system, install OpenOffice to convert rich text files and supported Microsoft&reg; Office files to PDF documents.
>* Dismiss all the dialog boxes that are displayed after installing Adobe Acrobat and third-party software for all the users configured to use the PDF Generator service.
>* Start all the installed software at least once. Dismiss all the dialog boxes for all the users configured to use the PDF Generator service.
>* [Check expiration date of your Adobe Acrobat serial numbers](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/kb/volume-license-expiration-check.html) and set a date to update license or [migrate your serial number](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/licensing.html#migrating-your-serial-number) based on the expiry date.  

After installing Acrobat, open Microsoft&reg; Word. On the **Acrobat** tab, click **Create PDF** and convert a .doc or .docx file available on your machine to a PDF Document. If the conversion is successful, AEM Forms is ready to use Acrobat with PDF Generator service.

### Setup environment variables {#setup-environment-variables}

Set environment variables for 64-bit Java Development Kit, third-party applications, and Adobe Acrobat. The environment variables should contain the absolute path of the executable used to start the corresponding application, for example, the table below lists environment variables for a few applications:

<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><p><strong>Application</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p><strong>Environment variable</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p><strong>Example</strong></p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><strong>JDK (64-bit)</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p>JAVA_HOME</p> </td>
   <td><p>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_74</p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><strong>Adobe Acrobat</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p>Acrobat_PATH</p> </td>
   <td><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 2015\Acrobat\Acrobat.exe</p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><strong>Notepad</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p>Notepad_PATH</p> </td>
   <td><p>C:\WINDOWS\notepad.exe<br /> <strong></strong></p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><p><strong>OpenOffice</strong></p> </td>
   <td><p>OpenOffice_PATH</p> </td>
   <td><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenOffice.org4</p> </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

>[!NOTE]
>
>* All environment variables and respective paths are case-sensitive.
>* JAVA_HOME and Acrobat_PATH (Windows only) are mandatory environment variables.  
>* The environment variable OpenOffice_PATH is set to the installation folder instead of the path to the executable.
>* Do not set up environment variables for Microsoft&reg; Office applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Project, or for AutoCAD. If these applications are installed on the server, the Generate PDF service automatically starts these applications.
>* On UNIX-based platforms, install OpenOffice as /root. If OpenOffice is not installed as root, the PDF Generator service fails to convert OpenOffice documents to PDF documents. If you are required to install and run OpenOffice as a non-root user, then provide sudo rights to the non-root user.  
>* If you are using OpenOffice on a UNIX-based platform, run the following command to set the path variable:  
>
>  `export OpenOffice_PATH=/opt/openoffice.org4`

### (Only for IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg;) Configure IBM&reg; SSL socket provider {#only-for-ibm-websphere-configure-ibm-ssl-socket-provider}

Perform the following steps to configure IBM&reg; SSL socket provider:

1. Create a copy of the java.security file. The default location of the file is `[WebSphere_installation_directory]\Appserver\java_[version]\jre\lib\security`.
1. Open the copied java.security file for editing.
1. Change the default SSL socket factories to use the JSSE2 factories instead of default IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; factories:

   **Default content:**

   ```shell
   #ssl.SocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.jsse2.SSLSocketFactoryImpl
   #ssl.ServerSocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.jsse2.SSLServerSocketFactoryImpl
   #WebSphere socket factories (in cryptosf.jar)
   ssl.SocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLSocketFactory
   ssl.ServerSocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLServerSocketFactory
   ```

   **Modified content:**

   ```shell
   ssl.SocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.jsse2.SSLSocketFactoryImpl
   ssl.ServerSocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.jsse2.SSLServerSocketFactoryImpl
   
   #WebSphere socket factories (in cryptosf.jar)
   #ssl.SocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLSocketFactory
   #ssl.ServerSocketFactory.provider=com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLServerSocketFactory
   ```

1. To enable AEM Forms Server to use the updated java.security file, while starting the AEM Forms server, add the following java argument:

   `-Djava.security.properties= [path of newly created Java.security file].`

### (Windows Only) Configure the file block settings for Microsoft&reg; Office {#configure-the-file-block-settings-for-microsoft-office}

    1. Ensure value of **EnableLUA** is set to 0 (zero). If the value is not 0, change the value to 0. Close the registry editor.

1. Restart your computer.

### (Windows Only) Disable Error Reporting service {#disable-error-reporting-service}

While converting a document to PDF using the PDF Generator service on Windows Server, occasionally, Windows Server reports that the executable has encountered a problem and must close. However, it does not impact the PDF conversion as it continues in the background.

To avoid receiving the error, you can disable the Windows error reporting. For more information on disabling error reporting, see [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754364.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754364.aspx).

### (Windows Only) Configure HTML to PDF conversion {#configure-html-to-pdf-conversion}

The PDF Generator service provides WebKit, WebCapture, and WebToPDF routes or methods to convert HTML files to PDF documents. On Windows, to enable conversion for WebKit and Acrobat WebCapture routes, copy the Unicode font to %windir%\fonts directory.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Whenever you install new fonts to the fonts folder, restart the AEM Forms instance.

### (UNIX-based platforms only) Extra configurations for HTML to PDF conversion  {#extra-configurations-for-html-to-pdf-conversion}

On UNIX-based platforms, the PDF Generator service supports WebKit and WebToPDF routes to convert HTML files to PDF documents. To enable HTML to PDF conversion, perform the following configurations, applicable to your preferred conversion route:

### (UNIX-based platforms only) Enable support for Unicode fonts (WebKit only) {#enable-support-for-unicode-fonts-webkit-only}

Copy the Unicode font to any of the following directories as appropriate for your system:

* /usr/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
* /usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType
* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ttf
* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype

### (Windows only) Configure Acrobat for the PDF Generator service {#configure-acrobat-for-the-pdf-generator-service}

On Microsoft&reg; Windows, the PDF Generator service uses Adobe Acrobat to convert supported file formats to a PDF document. Perform the following steps to configure Adobe Acrobat for the PDF Generator service:

1. Open Acrobat and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**> **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**> **[!UICONTROL Updater]**. In Check for updates, deselect **[!UICONTROL Automatically install updates]**, and click **[!UICONTROL OK]**. Close Acrobat.
1. Double-click a PDF document on your system. When Acrobat starts for the first time, the dialog boxes for Sign-in, Welcome screen, and EULA appear. Dismiss these dialog boxes for all the users configured to use PDF Generator.
1. Run the PDF Generator utility batch file to configure Acrobat for the PDF Generator service:

    1. Open [AEM Package Manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp) and download the `adobe-aemfd-pdfg-common-pkg-[version].zip` file from the Package Manager.
    1. Unzip the downloaded .zip file. Open the command prompt with administrative privileges.
    1. Navigate to the `[extracted-zip-file]\jcr_root\etc\packages\day\cq60\fd\adobe-aemds-common-pkg-[version]\jcr_root\etc\packages\day\cq60\fd\`
    1. Unzip the `adobe-aemfd-pdfg-common-pkg-[version]`.
    1. Navigate to the `[downloaded-adobe-aemfd-pdfg-common-pkg]\jcr_root\libs\fd\pdfg\tools\adobe-aemfd-pdfg-utilities-[version]` directory. Run the following batch file:

       `Acrobat_for_PDFG_Configuration.bat`

       Acrobat is configured to run with the PDF Generator service.

1. Run [System Readiness Tool (SRT)](#SRT) to validate Acrobat installation.

### (Windows only) Configure primary route for HTML to PDF conversion {#configure-primary-route-for-html-to-pdf-conversion-windows-only}

The PDF Generator service provides multiple routes to convert HTML files to PDF documents: Webkit, Acrobat WebCapture (Windows only), and WebToPDF. Adobe recommends using WebToPDF route because it has the capability to handle dynamic content and has no dependencies on 32-bit libraries or requires no extra fonts. Also, WebToPDF route does not require sudo or root access to run the conversion.

The default primary route for HTML to PDF conversion is Webkit. To change the conversion route:

1. On AEM author instance, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]**> **[!UICONTROL Forms]**> **[!UICONTROL Configure PDF Generator]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL General Configuration]** tab, select the preferred conversion route from the **[!UICONTROL Primary Route for HTML to PDF conversions]** drop-down.

### Initialize Global Trust Store {#intialize-global-trust-store}

Using the Trust Store Management, you can import, edit, and delete certificates that you trust on the server for validation of digital signatures and certificate authentication. You can import and export any number of certificates. After a certificate is imported, you can edit the trust settings and trust store type. Perform the following steps to initialize a trust store:

1. Log in to AEM Forms instance as an administrator.  
1. Go to  **[!UICONTROL Tools]** >  **[!UICONTROL Security]** >  **[!UICONTROL Trust Store]**.
1. Click  **[!UICONTROL Create TrustStore]**. Set password and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

### Set up certificates for Reader extension and encryption service {#set-up-certificates-for-reader-extension-and-encryption-service}

The DocAssurance service can apply usage rights to PDF documents. To apply usage rights to PDF documents, configure the certificates.

Before setting up the certificates, ensure that you have a:

* Certificate file (.pfx).

* Private Key password provided with the certificate.

* Private Key Alias. You can execute the Java keytool command to view the Private Key Alias:
`keytool -list -v -keystore [keystore-file] -storetype pkcs12`

* Keystore file password. If you are using Adobe's Reader Extensions certificate, the Keystore file password is always the same as Private Key password.

Perform the following steps to configure the certificates:

1. Log in to AEM Author instance as an administrator. Go to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Security]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL name]** field of the user account. The **[!UICONTROL Edit User Settings]** page opens. On the AEM Author instance, certificates reside in a KeyStore. If you have not created a KeyStore earlier, click **[!UICONTROL Create KeyStore]** and set a new password for the KeyStore. If the server already contains a KeyStore, skip this step.  If you are using Adobe's Reader Extensions certificate, the Keystore file password is always the same as Private Key password.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Edit User Settings]** page, select the **[!UICONTROL KeyStore]** tab. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Add Private Key from Key Store file]** option and provide an alias. The alias is used to perform the Reader Extensions operation.
1. To upload the certificate file, click **[!UICONTROL Select Key Store File]** and upload a &lt;filename&gt;.pfx file.

   Add the **[!UICONTROL Key Store Password]**, **[!UICONTROL Private Key Password]**, and **[!UICONTROL Private Key Alias]** that is associated with the certificate to the respective fields. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >In the production environment, replace your evaluation credentials with production credentials. Ensure that you delete your old Reader Extensions credentials, before updating an expired or evaluations credential.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]** on the **[!UICONTROL Edit User Settings]** page.

### Enable AES-256 {#enable-aes}

To use AES 256 encryption for PDF files, obtain and install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files. Replace the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files in the jre/lib/security folder. For example, if you are using Sun JDK, copy the downloaded files to the `[JAVA_HOME]/jre/lib/security` folder.

The Assembler service depends on the Reader Extensions service, Signature service, Forms service, and Output service. Perform the following steps to verify that the required services are up and running:

1. Log in to URL `https://'[server]:[port]'/system/console/bundles` as an administrator.
1. Search the following service and ensure that the services are up and running:

<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>

### (Windows only) Configure registry entry for Microsoft&reg; Project {#configure-registry-entry-for-microsoft-project}

After you install AEM Forms add-on and Microsoft&reg; Project on your machine, Register an entry for Microsoft&reg; Project in the 64-bit location. It facilitates the execution of Project to PDFG conversions tests. Following are the steps outlining the process for registry entry:

1. Open Microsoft&reg; Windows Registry editor (regedit), To open registry editor, go to Start > Run, type regedit, and click OK.
1. Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Acrobat PDFMaker\<version>\Office\SupportedApp`, and create a new **Binary Value** registry and rename it to **Project**.
1. Modify the data value of created Binary registry to 01 and click OK.
1. Close the registry entry.


## Known issues and troubleshooting {#known-issues-and-troubleshooting}

* The HTML to PDF conversion fails if a zipped input file contains HTML files with double-byte characters in filenames. To avoid this problem, do not use double-byte characters when naming HTML files.

* On UNIX-based operating systems, do the following to find any missing libraries:

1. Navigate to `[crx-repository]/bedrock/svcnative/HtmlToPdfSvc/bin/`.  

1. Run the following command to list all libraries that WebToPDF requires for HTML to PDF conversion.

   `ldd phantomjs`

   Run the following command to list missing libraries.

   `ldd phantomjs | grep not`

1. Manually install the missing libraries.

## System Readiness Tool (SRT) {#SRT}

The [System Readiness tool](#srt-configuration) checks if the machine is configured properly to run PDF Generator conversions. The tool generates report at the specified path. To run the tool:

1. Open command prompt. Navigate to the `[extracted-adobe-aemfd-pdfg-common-pkg]\jcr_root\libs\fd\pdfg\tools` folder.

1. Run the following command from the command prompt:

   `java -jar forms-srt-[version].jar [Path_of_reports_folder] en`

   The command generates report and also creates the srt_config.yaml file. You can use it to configure options for SRT tool. It is optional to configure options for SRT tool. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >* If the System Readiness Tool reports that the pdfgen.api file is not available in the Acrobat plug-ins folder then copy the pdfgen.api file from the `[extracted-adobe-aemfd-pdfg-common-pkg]\jcr_root\libs\fd\pdfg\tools\adobe-aemfd-pdfg-utilities-[version]\plugins\x86_win32` directory to the `[Acrobat_root]\Acrobat\plug_ins` directory.

1. Navigate to `[Path_of_reports_folder]`. Open the SystemReadinessTool.html file. Verify the report and fix the mentioned issues.

### Configuring options for the SRT tool {#srt-configuration}

You can use the srt_config.yaml file to configure various settings for the SRT tool. The format of the file is:

   ``` shell

      # =================================================================
      # SRT Configuration
      # =================================================================
      #Note - follow correct format to avoid parsing failures
      #for example, <param name>:<space><param value> 
      #locale: (mandatory field)Locale to be used for SRT. Supported locales [en/fr/de/ja].
      locale: en
