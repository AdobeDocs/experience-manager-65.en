# Employee recruitment reference site walkthrough {#employee-recruitment-reference-site-walkthrough}

## Overview {#overview}

We.Finance is an organization that allows candidates to apply for employment through the reference site portal. The organization also uses the portal to manage candidates' interviewing scheduling, shortlisting, and internal communication. The site manages the following:

* Candidates searching and applying for jobs
* Screening and shortlisting of candidates
* Interviewing process
* Collection of candidate details
* Candidate background checking
* Rolling out offers to selected candidates

>[!NOTE]
>
>Employee recruitment use cases are available in both We.Finance and We.Gov reference sites. The examples, images, and descriptions used in the walkthroughs use We.Finance reference site. However, you can run these use cases and review artifacts using We.Gov as well. To do so, replace **we-finance** with **we-gov** in the mentioned URLs.

### Workflow models involved {#workflow-models-involved}

The employee recruitment use case involves two workflows:

* Before the interview - We Finance Employee Recruiting workflow
* After the interview - We Finance Employee Recruiting Post Interview workflow

These workflows are created in AEM and can be found at:

### How it works {#how-it-works}

The We.Finance home page and the career page are AEM Sites pages. The career page embeds an adaptive form, which uses a repeatable panel to fetch job openings using a service and list them on the page. You can review the adaptive form at `https://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/employee/recruitment/jobs.html`.

### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself}

Go to `https://[publishHost]:[publishPort]/content/we-finance/global/en.html` and click **[!UICONTROL Career]**. Click **[!UICONTROL Search]** so that you populate the job list, and then click **[!UICONTROL Apply]** for a job. Fill details in the form and submit the application.

Ensure that you specify a valid email ID in the application as any communication through this walkthrough is sent to the specified email ID.
