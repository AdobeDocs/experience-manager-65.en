# Previewing a form {#previewing-a-form}

<span class="preview"> Adobe recommends using the modern and extensible data capture [Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html) for [creating new Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using/create-an-adaptive-form-core-components.md) or [adding Adaptive Forms to AEM Sites pages](/help/forms/using/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md). These components represent a significant advancement in Adaptive Forms creation, ensuring impressive user experiences. This article describes older approach to author Adaptive Forms using foundation components. </span>

## Overview {#overview}

In AEM Forms, you can preview the forms and documents present in the repository. Preview helps to know exactly how the forms look and behave when they are released to the end users.

When previewing forms, they are rendered in interactive interface and the user can fill the forms with data. When previewing documents, they are rendered in non-interactive mode and the user can only view the document. For forms, an additional option of Custom Preview is available. Using this option, you can preview the form using data from an XML file. The data fills up some or all fields of the form being previewed.

The following table lists the preview options available for different types of supported forms:

<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Asset type</strong><br /> </td>
   <td><strong>Available preview options</strong><br /> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Document</td>
   <td>PDF preview</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>PDF Form</td>
   <td>PDF preview and Preview with Data<br /> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>adaptive form</td>
   <td>HTML preview and HTML preview with Data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Form Template</td>
   <td>PDF preview, PDF preview with Data, HTML preview, HTML preview with Data<br /> </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
