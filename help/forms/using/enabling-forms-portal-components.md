Out of the box, forms portal components are not available for use. To make the components appear in the list of available components in AEM sidekick, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the author instance of your website and open an AEM Sites page.

1. For the pages using a static template, perform the following steps:

    1. In the page header, select ![canvas-drop-down](assets/canvas-drop-down.png) &gt; **Design** to open the page in Design mode.
    1. Select any component (with a blue border) and then select ![field-level](assets/field-level.png) to select the paragraph system containing the current component.
    1. In the paragraph system, select ![settings_icon](assets/settings_icon.png) to open the Edit dialog for the paragraph system.
    1. From the list of **[!UICONTROL Allowed Components]**, enable checkboxes for **[!UICONTROL Document Services]** and **[!UICONTROL Document Services Predicates]** components. Select **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

1. For the pages using a dynamic template, perform the following steps:

    1. In the page header, select ![properties](assets/properties.png) > **Edit Template** to open the template of the page.
    1. Select **Layout Container** and select ![FeedManagement](/help/forms/using/assets/feedmanagement.png). In the **Allowed Components** tab, enable the **Document Services and Document Services Predicates** options, and select ![aem_6_3_forms_save](assets/aem_6_3_forms_save.png).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also enable specific components from these categories by selecting the components. For more information about the components and their usage, see [Creating a form portal page](/help/forms/using/creating-form-portal-page.md) and [Embedding link component in a page](/help/forms/using/embedding-link-component-page.md).

Now, the Document Services and Document Services Predicates component categories are available in the components browser. The components are enabled for all the pages that use the same template.
