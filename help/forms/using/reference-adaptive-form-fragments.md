# Reference adaptive form fragments{#reference-adaptive-form-fragments}

[Adaptive form fragment](../../forms/using/adaptive-form-fragments.md) is a group of fields, or a panel containing a group of fields that you can use when you create a form. It lets you create a form easily and quickly. You can drag-drop an adaptive form fragment into a form using the assets browser in sidebar, and you can edit it in the form editor.

For adaptive forms authors, reference fragments are provided in the [AEM Forms add-on package](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/forms-updates/aem-forms-releases.html?lang=en). It includes the following fragments:

* Address
* Contact Information
* Credit card Information  
* Current Employment
* Dependents Information  
* Employment History
* Income & Expenditure
* Name  
* Terms & Conditions
* Terms & Conditions with Scribble

When you install the package, a Reference Fragments folder containing reference fragments is created under Forms & Documents. For installing a package, see [How to Work With Packages](/help/sites-administering/package-manager.md).
