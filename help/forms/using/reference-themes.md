# Reference Themes{#reference-themes}

[Themes](../../forms/using/themes.md) let you style your forms without deep knowledge of CSS. In addition to the default theme, you can get the following themes by installing the [AEM Forms add-on package](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/forms-updates/aem-forms-releases.html?lang=en):

* Beryl
* Exec
* Exec-Light
* Liberty
* Ultramarine
* Urbane
* U.S. Web Design Standards
* Tranquil

Each theme contains a unique and elegant style that you can use to create delightful adaptive forms for your users. It contains unique styling for selectors such as panel, text box, numeric box, radio button, table, and switch. Stylings in these themes are based on requirement. For example, in a particular scenario you require a minimalist theme with clean fonts. Liberty theme lets you achieve that look.
