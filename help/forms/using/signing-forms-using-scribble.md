# Apply electronic signatures to a form using scribble signatures{#apply-electronic-signatures-to-a-form-using-deprecated-scribble-signatures}

<span class="preview"> Adobe recommends using the modern and extensible data capture [Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/adaptive-forms/introduction.html) for [creating new Adaptive Forms](/help/forms/using/create-an-adaptive-form-core-components.md) or [adding Adaptive Forms to AEM Sites pages](/help/forms/using/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.md). These components represent a significant advancement in Adaptive Forms creation, ensuring impressive user experiences. This article describes older approach to author Adaptive Forms using foundation components. </span>

You can use the **Scribble Signature** component and **Signature Step** component to draw (Scribble) signature on an adaptive form. The Signature step component displays a PDF version of the adaptive form. You require a Document of Record option enabled or form template based adaptive forms to use the Signature step component.

## Various Options available in Signature Window

* **A:** Click the **Paint Brush** icon to draw your signature on canvas.
* **B:** Click the **Clear** icon to clear the signature on canvas.
* **C:** Click the **Geolocation** icon to add geolocation along with the signature.
* **D:** Click the **Keyboard** icon to type your name on canvas. 

 Once you select the Done![aem_6_3_forms_save](assets/aem_6_3_forms_save.png) icon in Scribble signature window, you cannot edit the signature. In case, if you want to edit the signature, you have to disregard the current signature and re-sign using the above Paint Brush/Keyboard option.

You can select the **Configure** ![configure](assets/configure.png) icon to set the aspect ratio of Scribble Signature canvas. 
* When the aspect ratio of the Scribble Signature canvas is less than 1, the geolocation information is added at the bottom of the Scribble Signature canvas.

* When the aspect ratio of the Scribble Signature canvas is more than 1, the geolocation information is added to the right-side of the Scribble Signature canvas.

1. Select the **Configure** ![configure](assets/configure.png) icon. It opens properties browser and displays properties of the Scribble Signature component. Configure properties of the Scribble Signature component.
1. Drag-and-drop the Signature Step component from component browser to the adaptive form.

1. In the Content browser, select **Form Container**, and select the **Configure** ![configure](/help/forms/using/assets/configure.png) icon. It opens properties browser and displays Adaptive Form container properties. Navigate to **Adaptive Form Container** &gt; **Electronic Signature** and deselect the **Enable Adobe Sign** option. Select the Done ![aem_6_3_forms_save](assets/aem_6_3_forms_save.png) icon to save the changes.

    * **Element Name**: Specify name of the component.

    * **Title:** Specify unique title of the component.
    * **Template message:** Specify the message to be displayed while the signature PDF is being loaded. Adobe Sign services take some time to prepare and load signature PDF.
    * **Signing Service:** Select the **Scribble Signature** option.

    * **CSS Class**: Specify CSS class of the client library, if any. Use [themes](../../forms/using/themes.md) and [in-line styles](../../forms/using/inline-style-adaptive-forms.md) instead of CSS Class.
