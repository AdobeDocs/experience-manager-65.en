# Managing the categories displayed in Workspace {#managing-the-categories-displayed-in-workspace}

In Workspace, the processes that a user can start are displayed in categories in the left navigation pane. You can set up the categories in administration console, or process designers can set them up in Workbench. When process designers creates processes, they assign them to categories.

When you specify category names, create them so that they appear properly in the Workspace navigation pane. By default, the left navigation pane has a fixed width of 210 pixels, which is approximately 24 characters. If the category name that you specify is too long to fit within the fixed width of the left navigation pane, it is truncated. The full name appears only when the mouse pointer is paused over it. Try to avoid category names that will be truncated. The following examples illustrate category names that fit and those that are truncated:

**Category name that fits:** Attendance & Leave

**Category name that is truncated:** Attendance & Leave (United States)

In Workspace, processes within a category are typically displayed as cards on the Start Process page. In general, six cards can be displayed on the screen for a category before the user is required to scroll to view remaining cards. Because scrolling makes it more difficult to find a process, consider limiting each category to six processes or, depending on your resolution, limiting the number of processes that can be displayed on the screen without requiring any scrolling.

If you are using MySQL as your AEM forms database, Administration Console cannot differentiate between two category names that differ only in the use of extended characters. For example, if you create a category named abcde and a category named âbcdè, they are considered the same.

You can remove only the categories that are not in use.
