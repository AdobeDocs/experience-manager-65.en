# Converting files using PDF Generator{#converting-files-using-pdf-generator}

You can use the PDF Generator web pages to convert files.

## Create a PDF file {#create-a-pdf-file}

1. In administration console, click Services &gt; PDF Generator &gt; Create PDF.
1. Click Browse to find and select the file.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >PDF Generator is able to automatically detect the file type of .doc, .xls, .ppt, and .rtf files, even when the file name is missing the file extension. This feature does not work with .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx files.

1. Under Configuration Settings, select Use Custom Settings or Upload Settings File.

    * If you are using custom settings, select an Adobe PDF setting, security setting, and file type setting and specify a time out.

      The Adobe PDF settings are applicable only to PS-to-PDF, EPS-to-PDF, PRN-to-PDF, Image-to-PDF with OCR on, and Native-to-PDF conversions. The time-out setting specifies the maximum time the conversion takes to complete. The default is 270 seconds. These settings are not used during Image-to-PDF and OpenOffice-to-PDF conversions.

    * If you are uploading a settings file, type its path and name in the box, or click Browse to find and select the file.

1. (Optional) Under XMP Metadata File, type the path and name of the XMP file, or click Browse to find and select the file. An XMP file can be used to include standard metadata information. (See [About XMP files](converting-files-using-pdf-generator.md#about-xmp-files).)
1. Click Create. When the file is created, a link to it appears. If an error occurs during conversion, a warning appears. If you are creating a Postscript file, the warning also contains a link to the log file.
1. Click the link for the PDF file. The file opens in Acrobat.

### About XMP files {#about-xmp-files}

PDF documents that PDF Generator creates in Acrobat 5.0 or later contain document metadata in XML format. *Metadata* includes information about the document and its contents, such as author's name, keywords, and copyright information that search utilities can use.

The document metadata contains (but is not limited to) information that also appears on the Description tab of the Document Properties dialog box in Acrobat. Changes that are made on the Description tab are reflected in the document metadata. Document metadata can be extended and modified by using third-party products.

Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) provides Adobe applications with a common XML framework that standardizes the creation, processing, and interchange of document metadata across publishing workflows. You can save and import the document metadata XML source code in XMP format, making it easy to share metadata among various documents. For more information about XMP files, see [Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)](https://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/) and [Adobe XMP Developer Center](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html).

You can create XMP files in Acrobat.
