# Setting up a PDFG Network Printer (Windows only) {#setting-up-a-pdfg-network-printer-windows-only}

PDFG Network Printer allows users to generate a PDF document from any application that supports printing. After a user installs the PDFG Network Printer, a new printer named *PDF generator* appears in the Printers section of the Windows Control Panel. If a printer with the same name already exists, the user is prompted to provide another name.

Printing to this printer from any application sends the document (in PostScript format) to PDF Generator, which converts the PostScript file to PDF. Depending on how you configured PDF Generator, it sends the PDF document to the user as an attachment to an email message, forwards the PDF document to a specified AEM forms service or process, or performs both actions.

The following steps are required to set up a PDFG Network Printer:

1. Configure email settings. (See [Configure email settings for PDFG Network Printer](setting-pdfg-network-printer-windows.md#configure-email-settings-for-pdfg-network-printer).)
1. In administration console, configure the PDFG Network Printer settings. (See [Configure the PDFG Network Printer settings](setting-pdfg-network-printer-windows.md#configure-the-pdfg-network-printer-settings).)
1. Ensure that your users are configured with a valid email address in the AEM forms database and assign the PDFGUserPermission to each user. <!-- Fix broken link See Setting up and organizing users -->
1. Ensure that 32-bit JRE6 is installed on your users' computers.
1. Install the printer on your users' computers. (See [Install PDFG Network Printer on a user's computer](setting-pdfg-network-printer-windows.md#install-pdfg-network-printer-on-a-user-s-computer).)

    * The email address to use to send PDFs to the users
    * The subject of the email message
    * The header, body, and footer of the email message. In the email message, &lt;receiverName&gt; is replaced with the full name of the user who printed the document.

    * The name of the service to invoke
