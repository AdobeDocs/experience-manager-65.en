# Configuring Task Manager endpoints {#configuring-task-manager-endpoints}

Task Manager endpoints enable Workspace users to invoke the service.

**Task Manager endpoint settings**

Use the following settings to configure a Task Manager endpoint.

**Name:** (Mandatory) Identifies the endpoint. The name is displayed in the card view in Workspace. Do not include a < character because it will truncate the name displayed in Workspace. If youâ€™re entering a URL as the name of the endpoint, ensure that it conforms with the syntax rules specified in RFC1738.

**Description:** A description of the endpoint. Do not include a < character because it will truncate the description displayed in Workspace.

**Task Instructions:** Instructions for the user who starts this workflow.

**Process Owner:** The name of the person who is responsible for the process.

**User Can Forward Task:** Allows the user to forward the initial task.

**Show Attachment Window:** Allows the user to see the attachment window.

**Allow Attachment Adding:** Allows the user to add attachments and notes.

**Task Initially Locked:** Locks the initial task.

**Add ACLs for Shared Queues:** The initial task is created with ACLs for shared queue users.

**Categorization:** (Mandatory) The category in which the user will see the form in Workspace. Select a category from the list, or select New Category to add a category.

**Operation Name:** (Mandatory) A list of operations that can be assigned to the endpoint.
