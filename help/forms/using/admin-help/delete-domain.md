# Delete a domain {#delete-a-domain}

Use the Domain Management page to mark an existing domain as obsolete.

If you create a domain with the same name as a deleted domain, the deleted domain is reinstated along with the information that it contained. The DefaultDom domain cannot be deleted.

1. In administration console, click **[!UICONTROL Settings > User Management > Domain Management]**.
1. Select the check box for the domain to delete, click **[!UICONTROL Delete]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
