# Configuring Shared Queues{#configuring-shared-queues}

Shared Queues allow you to configure and manage user queues effectively. A user queue is simply all tasks assigned to a user, see [To Do Lists](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/livecycle/11.0/WorkspaceHelp/WS92d06802c76abadb-2b6ab502126beb6ba2f-7ffc.2.html) for more information. You can assign, unassign, and reassign user queues depending on your organizational needs. You can manage Shared Queues in two ways:

**Manage Access To A User**

You can manage access to a selected user queue using this option.

**Manage Access By A User**

You can manage shared queues assigned to a selected user using this option.

## Managing access to a selected user queue {#managing-access-to-a-selected-user-queue}

Manage Access To A User functionality allows you to manage access to a selected user queue. You can grant or revoke access to a selected user queue to other users in your organization. For example, Kara Bowman is out of office. Using the Manage Access To A User functionality, her queue can be shared with Akira Tanaka and John Jacobs for completion. At a later point, when Kara Bowman returns to the office, you can revoke access to her queue from Akira Tanaka and John Jacobs.

Once shared, these tasks can be completed by the user, with access to the queue, using Workspace.
