# Creating and configuring roles{#creating-and-configuring-roles}

Using the User Management web pages, you can associate users and groups with roles that are already part of the User Management database. You can also create, edit, and delete roles.

User Management has two types of roles:

**Mutable roles:** This type of role can be edited and deleted, and role permissions can be added and deleted from these role types. Any role that you create is considered a mutable role. You can add or remove users and groups assigned to mutable roles.

**Immutable roles:** The default roles that are included with User Management are immutable roles. These roles cannot be edited or deleted. You can, however, add or remove users and groups assigned to immutable roles.

Both mutable and immutable roles can also be created through the AEM forms APIs.
