# Configuring Out of Office Settings {#configuring-out-of-office-settings}

The Out of Office feature enables users or administrators to specify when a user will be out of the office and unable to complete tasks assigned by AEM forms. While a user is set to Out of Office, their tasks are assigned to one or more designated users. Users can change their Out of Office settings in Workspace or administrators can change the settings on a user's behalf in forms workflow.

When creating a process, the Workbench user can specify whether a task can be redirected due to Out of Office settings.

## Assign a user for Out of Office tasks {#assign-a-user-for-out-of-office-tasks}

While a user is out of the office, you can assign one or more users to perform any new tasks for the user. You can set up the following configurations:

* Assign all the new tasks to a designated default user.
* Do not reassign any tasks. New tasks remain assigned to the user who is out of the office.
* Assign a default user who will receive most of the user's tasks, but specify that tasks from certain processes are reassigned to other users or remain assigned to the user who is out of the office.
* Do not assign a default user, but assign certain tasks from certain processes to specific users.

    1. In the Default User For Out of Office Tasks list, select a user from the list. If you do not want to designate a default user to receive reassigned items, select Do Not Assign.

       If the appropriate user name does not appear in the list, click Find User and use the Find User dialog box to search for the user. Select the appropriate user from the list and click Select User. You can also click View User's Schedule in the Find User dialog box to see the selected user's out of office schedule.
