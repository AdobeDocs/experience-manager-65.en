# Configuring SSL on Windows Vista {#configuring-ssl-on-windows-vista}

To configure SSL on Windows Vistaâ„¢, you need an SSL certificate with RSA keys for authentication. You can use the Java keytool to create the certificate.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Windows Vista will not work with DSA keys.

You can run keytool by using a single command that includes all the information that is required to create the certificate and keystore.

**Create an SSL certificate**

1. In a command prompt, navigate to *`[JAVA HOME]`*/bin and type the following command to create the certificate and keystore:

   `keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=`*Host Name* `, OU=`*Group Name* `, O=`*Company Name* `,L=`*City Name* `, S=`*State* `, C=`*Country Code* `" -alias`*"LC Cert"* `-keypass` `key`*_* *password* `-keystore`*keystorename* `.keystore`

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Replace *`[JAVA_HOME]` with the directory where the JDK is installed, and replace the text in italic with values that correspond with your environment.*

1. Type `changeit` as the password. This password is the default for a Java installation, and the system administrator may have changed it.
