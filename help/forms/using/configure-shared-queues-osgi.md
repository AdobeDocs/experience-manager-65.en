# Share and request access to Inbox items of a user {#share-and-request-access}

A queue is a list of items in AEM Inbox of a user. These can be items assigned to a user or items shared to the group a user is a member of. You can access your Inbox to view and take action on the Inbox item. For example, share an item with another user.

You can also share your Inbox items with another user. Once another user has access to your Inbox items, the user can claim and take appropriate action on shared items. Similarly, you can request access to Inbox items from other users.

## Pre-requisites {#pre-requisites}

The logged-in user must be a member of the `workflow-users` group. The user can share items or request access to items only from the users the logged-in user have read permissions on or only from the users who have enabled pubic profile.

## Share a single or all the items of your inbox with another user

AEM Inbox lets you share a single or all the items in your inbox with another user.

### Share all the inbox items

Perform the following steps to share all the items in an inbox with another user:

1. Log in to your AEM instance. Select the ![Inbox](assets/bell.svg) icon and select **[!UICONTROL View All]**. A list of your inbox items appear.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Share]** tab on the settings dialog.
1. Enter the name of a user in the **[!UICONTROL Grant access of your Inbox items]** text box and select **[!UICONTROL Grant]**. Repeat the step to add more users. All the users with access to your items appear under the **Username** section.
