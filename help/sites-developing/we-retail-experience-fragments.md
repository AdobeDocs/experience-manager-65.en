Trying out Experience Fragments in We.Retail

An [Experience Fragment](/help/sites-authoring/experience-fragments.md) is a group of one or more components including content and layout that can be referenced within pages. They can contain any component.

They allow an author to re-use parts of a page (a fragment of an experience), without having to copy and paste the content.

This supports the headless Content Management System (CMS) use-case, where authors want to use AEM only for authoring, but not for delivering to the customer. A third-party system/touchpoint can then consume that experience and then deliver to the end user.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**[Content Fragments](/help/sites-developing/we-retail-content-fragments.md)** and **Experience Fragments** are different features within AEM:
>
>* **Content Fragments** are editorial content, primarily text and related images. They are pure content, without design and layout.
>* **Experience Fragments** are fully laid out content; a fragment of a web page.
>
>Experience Fragments can contain content in the form of Content Fragments, but not the other way around.
