# Dialog Conversion Tool{#dialog-conversion-tool}

The dialog conversion tool is provided to help extend existing components that only have a dialog defined for the classic UI (based on ExtJS) or based on Granite UI and Coral 2. The tool uses the original dialog to create a duplicate dialog designed for the standard UI, based on Granite UI and Coral 3.

The dialog conversion tool is part of the [Adobe Modernization Tool suite](modernization-tools.md).
