# Headless Getting Started Guide {#introduction}

The Headless Getting Started Guides lay out a simple path for for creating, managing, and delivering experiences using AEM as a Cloud Service in five steps for users who are already familiar with AEM and headless technology. Each guide builds on the previous, so it is recommended to explore them thoroughly and in order.

1. [Creating a Configuration](create-configuration.md)
1. [Creating a Content Fragment Model](create-content-model.md)
1. [Creating an Assets Folder](create-assets-folder.md)
1. [Creating a Content Fragment](create-content-fragment.md)
1. [Accessing and Delivering Content Fragments](create-api-request.md)

>[!TIP]
>
>This getting started guide assumes knowledge of both AEM and headless technologies.
>
>If you are new to either AEM or headless, please refer to our [Headless Documentation Journeys](/help/journey-headless/home.md) for an end-to-end introduction to both headless and how AEM supports it.

## Audience {#audience}

The tasks described in the Headless Getting Started Guides are necessary for a basic end-to-end demonstration of AEM's headless capabilities. Anyone with administrator access to a test AEM instance can follow these guides to understand headless delivery in AEM, though someone with developer experience is ideal.

However in a production situation, the tasks will be performed by different personas a varying number of times. For example:

* **Administrators** will need to set up the initial configuration and folder structure for the content normally only once or sporadically.
* **Information architects** generally will add new models as the needs of the organization evolve.
* **Content authors** will continually create new content as Content Fragments based on the models defined by the architects.

The Headless Getting Started Guides point out who would generally perform the tasks described and how frequently.
