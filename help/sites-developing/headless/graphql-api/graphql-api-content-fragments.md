# AEM GraphQL API for use with Content Fragments {#graphql-api-for-use-with-content-fragments}

Learn how to use Content Fragments in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) with the AEM GraphQL API for headless content delivery.

AEM GraphQL API used with Content Fragments is heavily based on the standard, open source GraphQL API.

Using the GraphQL API in AEM enables the efficient delivery of Content Fragments to JavaScript clients in headless CMS implementations:

* Avoiding iterative API requests as with REST,
* Ensuring that delivery is limited to the specific requirements,
* Allowing for bulk delivery of exactly what is needed for rendering as the response to a single API query.

>[!NOTE]
>
>GraphQL is currently used in two (separate) scenarios in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM):
>
>* [AEM Commerce consumes data from a Commerce platform via GraphQL](/help/commerce/cif/integrating/magento.md).
>* AEM Content Fragments work together with the AEM GraphQL API (a customized implementation, based on standard GraphQL), to deliver structured content for use in your applications.

## The GraphQL API {#graphql-api}

GraphQL is:

* "*...a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.*". 

  See [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org)

* "*...an open spec for a flexible API layer. Put GraphQL over your existing backends to build products faster than ever before....*". 

  See [Explore GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com). 

* *"...a data query language and specification developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly open sourced in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST-based architectures with the purpose of increasing developer productivity and minimizing amounts of data transferred. GraphQL is used in production by hundreds of organizations of all sizes..."* 
  
  See [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).

### GraphQL Terminology {#graphql-terminology}

GraphQL uses the following:

* **[Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)**
  
* **[Schemas and Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)**:

  * Schemas are generated by AEM based on the Content Fragment Models.
  * Using your schemas, GraphQL presents the types and operations allowed for the GraphQL for AEM implementation.
  
* **[Fields](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields)**

* **[GraphQL Endpoint](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/graphql-endpoint.md#graphql-aem-endpoint)**
  * The path in AEM that responds to GraphQL queries, and provides access to the GraphQL schemas. 

  * See [Enabling your GraphQL Endpoint](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/graphql-endpoint.md#enabling-graphql-endpoint) for further details.

See the [(GraphQL.org) Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for comprehensive details, including the [Best Practices](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/).

### GraphQL Query Types {#graphql-query-types}

With GraphQL you can perform queries to return either:

* A **single entry**
  
* A **[list of entries](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null)**

AEM provides capabilities to convert queries (both types) to [Persisted Queries](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/persisted-queries.md), that can be cached by Dispatcher and the CDN.

### GraphQL Query Best Practices (Dispatcher and CDN) {#graphql-query-best-practices}

The [Persisted Queries](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/persisted-queries.md) are the recommended method to be used on publish instances as:

* they are cached
* they are managed centrally by AEM 

<!-- is this fully accurate? -->
>[!NOTE]
>
>Usually there is no dispatcher/CDN on author, so there is no performance gain in using persisted queries there; apart from testing them.

GraphQL queries using POST requests are not recommended as they are not cached, so on a default instance the Dispatcher is configured to block such queries.

While GraphQL also supports GET requests, these can hit limits (for example the length of the URL) that can be avoided using Persisted Queries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The ability to perform direct queries may be deprecated at some point in the future.

## GraphiQL Interface {#graphiql-interface}

An implementation of the standard [GraphiQL](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#graphiql) interface is available for use with AEM GraphQL. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>GraphiQL is included in all environments of AEM (but will only be accessible/visible when you configure your endpoints).
>
>In previous releases, a package was needed to install the GraphiQL IDE. If you have this installed, it can now be removed.

This interface allows you to directly input, and test, queries.

For example: 

* `http://localhost:4502/content/graphiql.html`

This provides features such as syntax-highlighting, auto-complete, auto-suggest, together with a history and online documentation:

![GraphiQL Interface](assets/cfm-graphiql-interface.png "GraphiQL Interface")

>[!NOTE]
>
>For further details see [Using the GraphiQL IDE](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/graphiql-ide.md).

## Use Cases for Author and Publish Environments {#use-cases-author-publish-environments}

The use cases can depend on the type of AEM environment:

* Publish environment; used to: 
  * Query data for JS application (standard use-case)

* Author environment; used to: 
  * Query data for "content management purposes":
    * GraphQL in AEM is currently a read-only API.
    * The REST API can be used for CR(u)D operations.

## Permissions {#permission}

The permissions are those required for accessing Assets.

GraphQL queries are executed with the permission of the AEM user of the underlying request. If the user does not have read access to some fragments (stored as Assets), they will not become part of the result set. 

Also, the user needs to have access to a GraphQL endpoint to be able to execute GraphQL queries. 

## Schema Generation {#schema-generation}

GraphQL is a strongly typed API, which means that data must be clearly structured and organized by type.

The GraphQL specification provides a series of guidelines on how to create a robust API for interrogating data on a certain instance. To do this, a client needs to fetch the [Schema](#schema-generation), which contains all the types necessary for a query. 

For Content Fragments, the GraphQL schemas (structure and types) are based on **Enabled** [Content Fragment Models](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-models.md) and their data types.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>All the GraphQL schemas (derived from Content Fragment Models that have been **Enabled**) are readable through the GraphQL endpoint.
>
>This means that you need to ensure that no sensitive data is available, as it could be leaked this way; for example, this includes information that could be present as field names in the model definition.

For example, if a user created a Content Fragment Model called `Article`, then AEM generates the object `article` that is of a type `ArticleModel`. The fields within this type correspond to the fields and data types defined in the model.

1. A Content Fragment Model:

   ![Content Fragment Model for use with GraphQL](assets/cfm-graphqlapi-01.png "Content Fragment Model for use with GraphQL")

1. The corresponding GraphQL schema (output from GraphiQL automatic documentation):
   ![GraphQL Schema based on Content Fragment Model](assets/cfm-graphqlapi-02.png "GraphQL Schema based on Content Fragment Model")

   This shows that the generated type `ArticleModel` contains several [fields](#fields). 
   
   * Three of them have been controlled by the user: `author`, `main` and `referencearticle`.

   * The other fields were added automatically by AEM, and represent helpful methods to provide information about a certain Content Fragment; in this example, `_path`, `_metadata`, `_variations`. These [helper fields](#helper-fields) are marked with a preceding `_` to distinguish between what has been defined by the user and what has been auto-generated.

1. After a user creates a Content Fragment based on the Article model, it can then be interrogated through GraphQL. For examples, see the [Sample Queries](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#graphql-sample-queries) (based on a [sample Content Fragment structure for use with GraphQL](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#content-fragment-structure-graphql)).

In GraphQL for AEM, the schema is flexible. This means that it is auto-generated each and every time a Content Fragment Model is created, updated or deleted. The data schema caches are also refreshed when you update a Content Fragment Model.

The Sites GraphQL service listens (in the background) for any modifications made to a Content Fragment Model. When updates are detected, only that part of the schema is regenerated. This optimization saves time and provides stability.

So for example, if you:

1. Install a package containing `Content-Fragment-Model-1` and `Content-Fragment-Model-2`:
 
   1. GraphQL types for `Model-1` and `Model-2` will be generated.

1. Then modify `Content-Fragment-Model-2`:

   1. Only the `Model-2` GraphQL type will get updated.

   1. Whereas `Model-1` will remain the same. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>This is important to note in case you want to do bulk updates on Content Fragment Models through the REST api, or otherwise.

The schema is served through the same endpoint as the GraphQL queries, with the client handling the fact that the schema is called with the extension `GQLschema`. For example, performing a simple `GET` request on `/content/cq:graphql/global/endpoint.GQLschema` will result in the output of the schema with the Content-type: `text/x-graphql-schema;charset=iso-8859-1`.

### Schema Generation - Unpublished Models {#schema-generation-unpublished-models}

When Content Fragments are nested it can happen that a parent Content Fragment Model is published, but a referenced model is not.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The AEM UI prevents this happening, but if publishing is made programmatically, or with content packages, it can occur.

When this happens, AEM generates an *incomplete* Schema for the parent Content Fragment Model. This means that the Fragment Reference, which is dependent on the unpublished model, is removed from the schema.

## Fields {#fields}

Within the schema there are individual fields, of two basic categories:

* Fields that you generate.

  A selection of [Field Types](#field-types) are used to create fields based on how you configure your Content Fragment Model. The field names are taken from the **Property Name** field of the **Data Type**.
  
  * There is also the **Render As** property to take into consideration, because users can configure certain data types; for example, as either a single line text or a multifield. 

* GraphQL for AEM also generates a number of [helper fields](#helper-fields).

  These are used to identify a Content Fragment, or to get more information about a content fragment.

### Field Types {#field-types}

GraphQL for AEM supports a list of types. All the supported Content Fragment Model Data Types and the corresponding GraphQL types are represented:

| Content Fragment Model - Data Type | GraphQL Type | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
| Single line Text | String, [String] | Used for simple strings such as author names, location names, etc. |
| Multi line Text | String | Used for outputting text such as the body of an article |
| Number | Float, [Float] | Used to display floating point number and regular numbers |
| Boolean | Boolean | Used to display checkboxes → simple true/false statements |
| Date And Time | Calendar | Used to display date and time in an ISO 8086 format. Depending on the type selected, there are three flavors available for use in AEM GraphQL: `onlyDate`, `onlyTime`, `dateTime` |
| Enumeration | String | Used to display an option from a list of options defined at model creation |
| Tags | [String] | Used to display a list of Strings representing Tags used in AEM |
| Content Reference | String | Used to display the path towards another asset in AEM |
| Fragment Reference | *A model type* | Used to reference another Content Fragment of a certain Model Type, defined when the model was created |

### Helper Fields {#helper-fields}

In addition to the data types for user generated fields, GraphQL for AEM also generates a number of *helper* fields in order to help identify a Content Fragment, or to provide additional information about a Content Fragment.

#### Path {#path}

The path field is used as an identifier in GraphQL. It represents the path of the Content Fragment asset inside the AEM repository. We have chosen this as the identifier of a content fragment, because it:

* is unique within AEM,
* can be easily fetched.

The following code will display the paths of all Content Fragments that were created based on the Content Fragment Model `Person`. 

```xml
{
  personList {
    items {
      _path
    }
  }
}
```

To retrieve a single Content Fragment of a specific type, you also need to determine its path first. for example:

```xml
{
  personByPath(_path: "/content/dam/path/to/fragment/john-doe") {
    item {
      _path
      firstName
      name
    }
  }
}
```

See [Sample Query - A Single Specific City Fragment](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-single-specific-city-fragment).

#### Metadata {#metadata}

Through GraphQL, AEM also exposes the metadata of a Content Fragment. Metadata is the information that describes a content fragment, such as the title of a content fragment, the thumbnail path, the description of a Content Fragment, the date it was created, amongst others.

Because Metadata is generated through the Schema Editor and as such does not have a specific structure, the `TypedMetaData` GraphQL type was implemented to expose the metadata of a Content Fragment. `TypedMetaData` exposes the information grouped by the following scalar types:

| Field |
|--- |
|`stringMetadata:[StringMetadata]!`|
|`stringArrayMetadata:[StringArrayMetadata]!`|
|`intMetadata:[IntMetadata]!`|
|`intArrayMetadata:[IntArrayMetadata]!`|
|`floatMetadata:[FloatMetadata]!`|
|`floatArrayMetadata:[FloatArrayMetadata]!`|
|`booleanMetadata:[BooleanMetadata]!`|
|`booleanArrayMetadata:[booleanArrayMetadata]!` |
|`calendarMetadata:[CalendarMetadata]!`|
|`calendarArrayMetadata:[CalendarArrayMetadata]!`|

Each scalar type represents either a single name-value pair or an array of name-value pairs, where the value of that pair is of the type it was grouped in. 

For example, if you want to retrieve the title of a Content Fragment, we know that this property is a String property, so we would query for all the String Metadata:

To query for metadata:

```xml
{
  personByPath(_path: "/content/dam/path/to/fragment/john-doe") {
    item {
      _path
      _metadata {
        stringMetadata {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can view all the metadata GraphQL types if you view the Generated GraphQL schema. All model types have the same `TypedMetaData`. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Difference between normal and array metadata**
>Keep in mind that `StringMetadata` and `StringArrayMetadata` both refer to what is stored in the repository, not how you retrieve them. 
>
>So for example, by calling the `stringMetadata` field, you would receive an array of all the metadata that was stored in the repository as a `String` , and if you call `stringArrayMetadata` you would receive an array of all the metadata that was stored in the repository as `String[]`.

See [Sample Query for Metadata - List the Metadata for Awards titled GB](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-metadata-awards-gb).

#### Variations {#variations}

The `_variations` field has been implemented to simplify querying the variations that a Content Fragment has. For example:

```xml
{
  personByPath(_path: "/content/dam/path/to/fragment/john-doe") {
    item {
      _variations
    }
  }
}
```

See [Sample Query - All Cities with a Named Variation](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-cities-named-variation).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the given variation does not exist for a Content Fragment, then the master variation will be returned as a (fallback) default.

<!--
## Security Considerations {#security-considerations}
-->

## GraphQL Variables {#graphql-variables}

GraphQL permits variables to be placed in the query. For more information you can see the [GraphQL documentation for Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).

For example, to get all Content Fragments of type `Article` that have a specific variation, you can specify the variable `variation` in GraphiQL.

![GraphQL Variables](assets/cfm-graphqlapi-03.png "GraphQL Variables")

```xml
### query
query GetArticlesByVariation($variation: String!) {
    articleList(variation: $variation) {
        items {
            _path
            author
            _variations
        }
    }
}
 
### in query variables
{
    "variation": "uk"
}
```

## GraphQL Directives {#graphql-directives}

In GraphQL there is a possibility to change the query based on variables, called GraphQL Directives.

For example there you can include the `adventurePrice` field in a query for all the `AdventureModels`, based on a variable `includePrice`.

![GraphQL Directives](assets/cfm-graphqlapi-04.png "GraphQL Directives")

```xml
### query
query GetAdventureByType($includePrice: Boolean!) {
  adventureList {
    items {
      adventureTitle
      adventurePrice @include(if: $includePrice)
    }
  }
}
 
### in query variables
{
    "includePrice": true
}
```

## Filtering {#filtering}

You can also use filtering in your GraphQL queries to return specific data. 

Filtering uses a syntax based on logical operators and expressions. 

For example, the following (basic) query filters all persons that have a name of `Jobs` or `Smith`:

```xml
query {
  personList(filter: {
    name: {
      _logOp: OR
      _expressions: [
        {
          value: "Jobs"
        },
        {
          value: "Smith"
        }
      ]
    }
  }) {
    items {
      name
      firstName
    }
  }
}
```

## GraphQL for AEM - Summary of Extensions {#graphql-extensions}

The basic operation of queries with GraphQL for AEM adhere to the standard GraphQL specification. For GraphQL queries with AEM there are a few extensions:

* If you require a single result:
  * use the model name; eg city

* If you expect a list of results:
  * add `List` to the model name; for example,  `cityList`
  * See [Sample Query - All Information about All Cities](#sample-all-information-all-cities)

* The filter `includeVariations` is included in the `List` query type.  To retrieve Content Fragment Variations in the query results, then the `includeVariations` filter must be set to `true`.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >The filter `includeVariations` cannot be used together with the system-generated field `_variation`.

* If you want to use a logical OR:
  * use ` _logOp: OR`
  * See [Sample Query - All Persons that have a name of "Jobs" or "Smith"](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-all-persons-jobs-smith)

* Logical AND also exists, but is (often) implicit

* You can query on field names that correspond to the fields within the Content Fragment Model
  * See [Sample Query - Full Details of a Company's CEO and Employees](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-full-details-company-ceos-employees)

* In addition to the fields from your model, there are some system-generated fields (preceded by underscore):

  * For content:

    * `_locale` : to reveal the language; based on Language Manager
      * See [Sample Query for multiple Content Fragments of a given locale](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-wknd-multiple-fragments-given-locale)

      * See [Sample Query - A Single Specific City Fragment](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-single-specific-city-fragment)

    * `_reference` : to reveal references; including inline references in the Rich Text Editor
      * See [Sample Query for multiple Content Fragments with Prefetched References](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-wknd-multiple-fragments-prefetched-references)

    * `_variation` : to reveal specific Variations within your Content Fragment

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >If the given variation does not exist for a Content Fragment, then the master variation will be returned as a (fallback) default.

      >[!CAUTION]
      >The system-generated field `_variation` cannot be used together with the filter `includeVariations`.

      * See [Sample Query - All Cities with a Named Variation](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-cities-named-variation)

    * `_tags` : to reveal the IDs of Content Fragments or Variations that contain tags; this is an array of `cq:tags` identifiers. 

      * See [Sample Query - Names of All Cities Tagged as City Breaks](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-names-all-cities-tagged-city-breaks)

    * See [Sample Query for a Content Fragment of a specific Model with a Content Reference](/help/sites-developing/headless/graphql-api/content-fragments-graphql-samples.md#sample-wknd-fragment-specific-model-content-reference)

* Fallback when querying nested fragments:

  * If the requested variation does not exist in a nested fragment, then the **Master** variation will be returned.

### CORS Filter {#cors-filter}

>[!NOTE]
>
>For a detailed overview of the CORS resource sharing policy in AEM see [Understand Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/security/understand-cross-origin-resource-sharing.html#understand-cross-origin-resource-sharing-(cors)).

To access the GraphQL endpoint, a CORS policy must be configured in the customer Git repository. This is done by adding an appropriate OSGi CORS configuration file for the desired endpoint(s). 

This configuration must specify a trusted website origin `alloworigin` or `alloworiginregexp` for which access must be granted.

For example, to grant access to the GraphQL endpoint and persisted queries endpoint for `https://my.domain` you can use:

```xml
{
  "supportscredentials":true,
  "supportedmethods":[
    "GET",
    "HEAD",
    "POST"
  ],
  "exposedheaders":[
    ""
  ],
  "alloworigin":[
    "https://my.domain"
  ],
  "maxage:Integer":1800,
  "alloworiginregexp":[
    ""
  ],
  "supportedheaders":[
    "Origin",
    "Accept",
    "X-Requested-With",
    "Content-Type",
    "Access-Control-Request-Method",
    "Access-Control-Request-Headers"
  ],
  "allowedpaths":[
    "/content/_cq_graphql/global/endpoint.json",
    "/graphql/execute.json/.*"
  ]
}
```

If you have configured a vanity path for the endpoint, you can also use it in `allowedpaths`.

### Referrer Filter {#referrer-filter}

In addition to CORS configuration, a Referrer filter must be configured to allow access from third party hosts.

This is done by adding an appropriate OSGi Referrer Filter configuration file that:

* specifies a trusted website host name; either `allow.hosts` or `allow.hosts.regexp`,
* grants access for this host name.

For example, to grant access for requests with the Referrer `my.domain` you can:

```xml
{
    "allow.empty":false,
    "allow.hosts":[
      "my.domain"
    ],
    "allow.hosts.regexp":[
      ""
    ],
    "filter.methods":[
      "POST",
      "PUT",
      "DELETE",
      "COPY",
      "MOVE"
    ],
    "exclude.agents.regexp":[
      ""
    ]
}
```

>[!CAUTION]
>
>It remains the customer's responsibility to:
>
>* only grant access to trusted domains 
>* make sure no sensitive information is exposed 
>* not use a wildcard [*] syntax; this will both disable authenticated access to the GraphQL endpoint and also expose it to the entire world.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>All the GraphQL [schemas](#schema-generation) (derived from Content Fragment Models that have been **Enabled**) are readable through the GraphQL endpoint.
>
>This means that you need to ensure that no sensitive data is available, as it could be leaked this way; for example, this includes information that could be present as field names in the model definition.
