# Trying out the Globalized Site Structure in We.Retail{#trying-out-the-globalized-site-structure-in-we-retail}

We.Retail has been built with a globalized site structure offering a language masters that can be live-copied to country-specific web sites. Everything is set up out-of-the-box to allow you to experiment with this structure and the built-in translation capabilities.

## Trying it out {#trying-it-out}

1. Open the sites console from **Global Navigation -&gt; Sites**.
1. Switch to column view (if not already active) and select We.Retail. Note the example country structure with Switzerland, the United States, France, etc., along side the Language Masters.

1. Return to column view and click on the Language Master and see the language master roots with content. Note that only English has content.

   We.Retail does not come with any translated content, but the structure and configuration is in place to allow you to demonstrate the translation services.
