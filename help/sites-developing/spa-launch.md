## Tutorial {#tutorial}

To understand how to integrate your SPA with Adobe Experience Platform Launch, see [this knowledge base article and tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/sites/spa-editor/spa-editor-framework-feature-video-use.html), which guides you through the Launch setup and implement the Experience Cloud in built with Angular or React.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The referenced KB was created to enable Adobe Experience Platform Launch integration with SPAs that do not use the Adobe Experience Manager SPA Editor. These methods should also allow the Adobe Experience Platform Launch integration to coexist with SPAs that are built to use the SPA Editor.
>
>The use of Redux alongside the JavaScript SPA libraries has not been fully explored. Support of Redux is planned in a future release of the SPA Editor.
