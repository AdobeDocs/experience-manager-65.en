# Code Samples{#code-samples}

The Adobe Consulting Services Team has generated a series of AEM code samples. These samples are well commented pieces of code to help AEM Developers understand the key building blocks of AEM. The samples are available here: [https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-samples/](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-samples/).

A multi-part tutorial designed for developers new to AEM covering fundamental topics like project setup, Core Components, Editable Templates, Client Libraries and component development: [Getting Started with AEM Sites - WKND Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/sites/using/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop.html)

The Adobe AEM Community team creates Developer How To articles. You can find the articles [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/topics/how-to.html).

A Maven template to create a new AEM project as starting point to develop your own functionality is available [here](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype).

Standard, touch-enabled UI code samples are available [here](/help/sites-developing/developing-components.md).
