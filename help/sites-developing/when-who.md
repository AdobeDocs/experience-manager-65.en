# Testing - when and with whom?{#testing-when-and-with-whom}

Various roles can be involved in testing and at various stages of project development.

<table>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Test Team</td>
   <td>Responsible for... </td>
   <td>When...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Development Team</td>
   <td>The development team is responsible for your unit tests and some integration tests.</td>
   <td>These tests are first in the chain, though they will be repeated / extended during development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Quality Assurance Team</td>
   <td><p>You will need a Quality Assurance Team (of whatever size appropriate) for functional and performance tests.</p> <p>These are neutral, dedicated testers - a golden rule of software always states that a developer should never test their own work.</p> <p>The members of this team may be drawn from the Day project team, the partner and/or your customer team.</p> </td>
   <td><p>The first function release should be made available to the testers (as soon as is realistically possible). Although an early interim release may generate a lot of bugs, it can provide early feedback on critical issues.</p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Customer Test Team</td>
   <td><p>Depending on the Project Model selected it may be planned for members of the customer team to be involved in testing, in particular authors from the customer site.</p> <p>The is advantageous as it:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><p>Provides the customer with experience of the project being developed.</p> </li>
     <li><p>Provides early feedback from the customer.</p> </li>
     <li><p>Users often express their requirements in terms of past experience; involving the customers in testing as early as possible increases their experience of the new project in terms of <i>hands-on</i> experience.</p> </li>
    </ul> </td>
   <td><p>Again early involvement is good, though any release the customers use should be stable, with reasonable functionality.</p> <p>First impressions are always important.</p> </td>
  </tr>
