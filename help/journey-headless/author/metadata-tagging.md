# Learn about defining Metadata and Tagging for Content Fragments {#author-headless-metadata-tagging}

## The Story so Far {#story-so-far}

At the beginning of the [AEM Headless Content Author Journey](overview.md) the [Introduction](introduction.md) covered the basic concepts and terminology relevant to authoring for headless.

In the previous step you were introduced to the use of references for Headless CMS Authoring. You learned what sorts of references are available, and what are their purposes: Content References, Asset/Media References, and Fragment References.

This article builds on these so you understand how to use metadata and tagging to author your own content for your AEM headless project.

## Objective {#objective}

* **Audience**: Advanced
* **Objective**: Introduce the use of metadata and tagging for Headless CMS Authoring. 

## Adding Metadata and Tags {#adding-metadata-and-tags}

There are three methods that you can use to add metadata and tags:

* When first creating your fragment:

  ![Create Content Fragment - provide Name](/help/journey-headless/author/assets/headless-journey-author-content-fragment-03.png)
  
* The **Metadata** tab of the Content Fragment editor allows you to add both various fields of metadata, and predefined **Tags** from your project: 

  ![Content Fragment Editor - Metadata](/help/journey-headless/author/assets/headless-journey-author-metadata-01.png)

  * This is also directly accessible using the **Properties** option in the toolbar of the Assets console.

## What's Next {#whats-next}

Now you can put all this knowledge to use and start creating Content Fragments for your project.
