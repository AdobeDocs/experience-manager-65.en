# AEM Headless Journeys {#aem-headless-journeys}

Start here for an overview of the guided journeys available to understand AEM's powerful headless features.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. It is a modern and dynamic development pattern for implementing digital experiences.

If you are new to AEM and/or headless, AEM's Headless Journeys are a great place to start to understand the theory and technology by way of a narrative to solve various business problems in a headless fashion.

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/home.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve headless business cases with AEM, AEM Headless Journeys are where to start.

## Audiences {#audiences}

Headless Journeys are designed for varying personas, laying out the requirements, steps, and approach to implementing headless solutions from different perspectives.

An individual journey is defined for a specific persona or audience, but also defines additional personas with which the reader interacts.

Information in the journeys can be useful to multiple personas, but a journey is targeted to a specific persona and some information may be superfluous to certain roles.
