# AEM Headless Translation Journey {#aem-headless-translation-journey}

Start here for a guided journey through translating your headless content using AEM's powerful translation tools.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Headless implementation is increasingly becoming important for delivering experiences to your audience, wherever they are and regardless of channel, region, or locale.

Headless implementation forgoes page and component management as is traditional in full stack solutions and focuses on the creation of channel-neutral, reusable fragments of content and their cross-channel delivery. By using AEM's powerful translation tools, these reusable fragments can be easily translated and delivered to your audience wherever it may be.

This guide leads you through the most important headless translation topics so that on completion you:

* Have an overview of what headless content delivery is.
* Have a basic understanding AEM's headless features.
* Understand AEM's translation features and how they related to headless content.
* Have the ability to start translating your own headless content.

The goal is to give you a broad understanding of headless technology, how AEM serves headless content, and how you can translate it. If you are not familiar with any of these topics, this is your ideal place to start.

If you are already familiar with AEM, headless, and translation, you may already have the foundational knowledge of this journey. Consider referring to our technical documentation linked under the [additional resources section below.](#additional-resources)

## AEM Documentation Journeys {#documentation-journeys}

[A Documentation Journey](/help/journey-documentation/home.md) ties together many different and perhaps complicated topics and features by providing a narrative that helps the reader, who can be new to AEM, understand and solve a business problem from beginning to end, while assuming minimal prior topic or AEM knowledge.

Documentation Journeys are designed around best practices principles, informed by Adobe's latest research, proven implementation experience from Adobe consultants, and feedback from customer projects.

If you want to know how Adobe recommends how to solve headless business cases with AEM, [AEM Headless Journeys](/help/journey-headless/home.md) are where to start.

## Audience {#audience}

This journey is designed for the translation specialist persona, often referred to as the Translation Project Manager or TPM. This journey lays out the requirements, steps, and approach to translate headless content in AEM. The journey may define additional personas with which the translation specialist must interact, but the point-of-view for the journey is that of the translation specialist.

This journey assumes the reader has experience translating content on a large CMS system, but assumes no knowledge of headless technology or AEM.

The following are the personas that interact in this journey.

|Persona|Description|Role in Journey|
|---|---|---|
|Translation Specialist|Defines what content should be translated and manages those workflows|Audience of this journey|
|Content Author|Creates and manage content that is delivered headlessly|Content Authors create content that the translation specialist must translate.|
|Administrator|Manages the base setup and configuration of AEM|The translation specialist works with the administrator to make configuration changes needed for translation such as installing a translation connector.|
|Content Architect|Analyzes the requirements for the data that must be delivered headlessly and defines the structure for this data|Translation specialists work with the content architect to define the organization of the content so it can be easily translated.|

Information in this journey can of course be useful to all personas, but some information may be superfluous to certain roles. Stay tuned for [forthcoming journeys covering additional roles.](/help/journey-documentation/home.md#journeys)
