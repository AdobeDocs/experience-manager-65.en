# Authoring Pages{#authoring-pages}

The following provide two types of overview to authoring with AEM:

* [First Steps for Authors](../../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/first-steps.md) - an introduction for new authors  

* [Quick Guide to Authoring Pages](../../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/qg-page-authoring.md) - a quick guide (high-level) to the main actions

>[!NOTE]
>
>This section covers the tasks involved when authoring a content page. There are many additional features closely related to page authoring, covered in other sections of the [Authoring Guide](/6-5/sites/authoring/user-guide.md).

## Quick Overview of Features Used for Authoring Pages {#quick-overview-of-features-used-for-authoring-pages}

To aid you when authoring pages the author environment provides features such as:

* **Drag and drop** 
  Components (such as Text, Image) and digital assets (such as images) can be positioned on the page simply by dragging and dropping them in the desired location.

* **Editing** 
  Once positioned on your page, a component-specific dialog can be opened to enter content and/or configure characteristics of that component (for example, image size).  

* **In-place Editing** 
  Text and Image components can be edited directly on the webpage without opening a dialog box or an explicit save action.

* ** [Component Browser](../../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.md#componentsbrowsertouchoptimizedui)** 
  On the left side of an editable page a sliding browser can be opened; from here components can be dragged onto the page and then edited.

* ** [Asset Browser](../../../../6-5/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.md#assetsbrowsertouchoptimizedui)** 
  On the left side of an editable page a sliding browser can be opened; from here assets can be dragged onto the page; for example to position assets or create links to other pages.

* **Component Toolbar** 
  Both a single or a slow double click/tap will reveal the appropriate toolbar (single for the inplace editing toolbar, then slow double for full toolbar).

* ** [Responsive Layout](/6-5/sites/authoring/using/responsive-layout.md)** 
  This provides a paragraph system that allows you to position components within a responsive grid.

* **Search as you type** 
  In certain scenarios (for example, path selection in edit dialogs) searching for content through the AEM interface presents dynamic matches as you type the query.
