## Use AI Assistant in AEM {#ai-use} 

<!-- UNHIDE AFTER BETA or at GA
### Enable AI Assistant in AEM access through Admin Console 

To use the AI Assistant in AEM, your organization must opt in at the Admin Console level. A product administrator creates (or chooses) a user group and grants it the new "AI Assistant" permission. Anyone added to that group instantly gains access to the Assistant across AEM. If the goal is company-wide availability, the admin simply assigns all users to that group.

![AI Assistant in AEM in the Admin Console](/help/implementing/cloud-manager/assets/ai-assistant-admin-console.png)

From an employee's perspective, the process is straightforward: identify the product administrator for Adobe Experience Manager in your organization and request to be added to the AI-enabled user group. Once you appear in that group, the Assistant icon shows up automatically the next time you sign in.

Administrators should keep normal Cloud Manager governance in mind. Hold product administrator rights in the Admin Console to create profiles, manage user groups, or edit permissions. If users also need the Assistant's built-in **Create Support Ticket** feature, add the standard **Support Admin** role (standard Admin Console role) to the same individuals or group.
