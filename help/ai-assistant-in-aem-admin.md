# Configure AI Assistant in AEM {#aem-ai-asst-admin-setup}

<!-- An Administrator must configure access, permissions, and settings before users in their organization can use the features in AI Assistant in AEM. -->

<!-- badge: label="Beta" type="Positive" -->

To use the AI Assistant in AEM (Adobe Experience Manager), your organization must opt in at the Admin Console level. A product administrator creates (or chooses) a user group and grants it the new "AI Assistant" permission. Anyone added to that group instantly gains access to the AI Assistant across AEM. If the goal is company-wide availability, the admin simply assigns all users to that group.

From an employee's perspective, the process is straightforward: identify the product administrator for Adobe Experience Manager in your organization and request to be added to the AI-enabled user group. Once you appear in that group, the Assistant icon shows up automatically the next time you sign in.

Administrators should keep normal Cloud Manager governance in mind. Hold product administrator rights in the Admin Console to create profiles, manage user groups, or edit permissions. If users also need the Assistant's built-in **Create Support Ticket** feature, add the standard **Support Admin** role (standard Admin Console role) to the same individuals or group.

The configuration process of the AI Assistant in AEM consists of the following steps:

1. [Create a new product profile in the Adobe Admin Console](#create-profile).
1. [Enable the AI Assistant Product Knowledge permission](#enable-permission).
1. [Create a new user group (or use an existing user group)](#create-user-group).
1. [Add users to the user group](#add-users).
1. [Assign the product profile to the user group](#assign-product-profile).

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, be sure you have met the following prerequisites:

* You must have product administrator rights at a minimum in the Adobe Admin Console.
* You have an understanding of your organization's user management structure.

**Configuration considerations**
    
* Processing time: Resources created in Cloud Manager may take up to 2 minutes to display in the Admin Console for permission configuration.
* Multiple profiles: Users can be part of multiple profiles, and permissions are combined from all assigned profiles.
* Organization scope: Some permissions may apply at the organization level across all programs.
* Predefined profiles: Do not delete predefined permission profiles from the Admin Console.
