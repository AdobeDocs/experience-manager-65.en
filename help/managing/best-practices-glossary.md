# Glossary{#glossary}

This glossary lists (alphabetically) details of all Deliverable documents from the [Project Checklist](/help/managing/best-practices-checklist.md).

## Acceptance from Business Stakeholders {#acceptance-from-business-stakeholders}

Acceptance from business stakeholders confirms that they, as key stakeholders, are aligned with the solution and have given their approval as to how the business requirements meet the business case.

### Acceptance Tests {#acceptance-tests}

Acceptance testing is performed when an application is ready for production. The tests are performed by a group representing the various types of end-user, using real-life scenarios.

Acceptance tests are used to confirm that the:

* Project fulfills the customer's requirements.
* Solution is fit-for-purpose.
* Users accept the solution and can envisage working with it.
* Customer accepts the project.

The earlier you plan and design your acceptance tests, the easier the final deployment. They should be defined together with the customer and your Quality Assurance team.

Although you might not be able to define all details at the very start of the project, initial definitions should be discussed and agreed on. The acceptance tests will probably be based on the fundamental requirements (functional and performance).

### Access to Test System Coordinated {#access-to-test-system-coordinated}
