## AEM Mobile Author {#aem-mobile-author}

An ***AEM Author* (or *Marketer*)** uses custom-developed or out-of-the-box templates and components to add and edit pages, drag and drop components and add media of all types from the DAM including images, videos, and text fragments (content fragments). AEM's built-in content editor is then used by *AEM Authors* to create rich and relevant experiences within the app, including integration with the rest of the Adobe Experience Cloud.

An AEM author is responsible for the following tasks while creating an app using AEM Mobile On-Demand Services.

**Authoring AEM Content for AEM Mobile On-Demand Services App** involves following actions:

* [AEM Mobile Application Dashboard](/help/mobile/mobile-apps-ondemand-application-dashboard.md)

* [Cloud Configuration](/help/mobile/mobile-on-demand-associating-an-on-demand-app-to-cloud-configuration.md)
* [Managing Content](/help/mobile/mobile-apps-ondemand-manage-content-ondemand.md)
