# Starting AEM PhoneGap {#starting-aem-phonegap}

{{ue-over-mobile}}

For developers, the best place to start is to look at the Adobe Experience Manager Mobile Starterkit in github

https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit

The starterkit gets you going quickly by walking you through the basics of AEM Mobile development. It starts with project creation and governance, installing the necessary tooling, defining a Maven archetype, building, deploying and then creating your own experience.

The developers can use this example as a starting point for trying out an AEM Mobile application using PhoneGap. Running through the starterkit and the reference application gives a solid understanding of the basics to create rich Mobile Applications.

* Use the [AEM PhoneGap Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-phonegap-starter-kit) to create apps suitable for the AEM Mobile catalog.
* A [reference app](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps/aem-mobile-hybrid-reference) with full source has been created that demonstrates many of the new features in AEM Mobile, whether you are migrating an existing app into AEM Mobile or starting fresh.
* All the samples can be found on github: [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud-Apps) and include bootstrapping your project with Maven.
* Most conference talks use the [Kitchen Sink tutorial](https://github.com/blefebvre/aem-phonegap-kitchen-sink), which you can also find in GitHub and is focused on the usage of Apache Cordova native extensibility.

>Once you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the starterkit, it is important to learn about Adobe Experience Manager *components and templates.*

## Templates and Components {#templates-and-components}

AEM *Templates* and *Components* enable line-of-business owners to create custom experiences. Both *Templates *and *Components* are available out-of-the-box or can be custom developed by you, the developer either by extending existing components or creating greenfield (advanced). *Templates* and *Components* are what allow the AEM Author to drag and drop to create engaging and relevant experiences.

1. [Creating Components](/help/sites-developing/components.md)
1. [Creating Templates](/help/sites-developing/templates.md)

Once you have a solid understanding of the above two steps, jump into:
