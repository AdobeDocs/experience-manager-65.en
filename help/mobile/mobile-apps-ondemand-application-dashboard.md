# AEM Mobile Application Dashboard {#aem-mobile-application-dashboard}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md).

You can manage your application and mobile app content from AEM Mobile Application Dashboard or the Control Center.

You can drill into each tile in the Control Center to view or edit details by clicking the '...' in the bottom right corner.

>You can rearrange the order of the tiles by clicking the tile's grabber icon (top left 9 dots). The order change is user specific - different for individual users.

Managing app content requires a collective effort from developers, content authors and administrators. Authors manipulate pages, which are in turn based off of templates and components generated by app developers.

Finally, administrators strategically publish the updated app content.

## The Manage App Tile {#the-manage-app-tile}
