# AEM Mobile Application Dashboard {#aem-mobile-application-dashboard}

>[!NOTE]

>You can rearrange the order of the tiles by clicking the tile's grabber icon (top left 9 dots). The order change is user specific - different for individual users.

Managing app content requires a collective effort from developers, content authors and administrators. Authors manipulate pages, which are in turn based off of templates and components generated by app developers.

Finally, administrators strategically publish the updated app content.
