# Administering Content for Adobe PhoneGap Enterprise with AEM {#administering-content-for-adobe-phonegap-enterprise-with-aem}

{{ue-over-mobile}}

An ***AEM administrator*** is responsible for adding a new application to the AEM Mobile catalog, either by creating an app using the creation wizard, or by importing an existing application. AEM administrators who create an app using AEM Mobile's *creation wizard*, typically select one of the desired app templates either from Adobe's out-of-the-box reference samples or (usually) a custom app template created by *AEM developers.*

After you've built your mobile application using HTML5 and PhoneGap, you can manage it within the Command Center. You can also manage the HTML5 content for a native app in the Command Center using Cordova webviews (to allow for PhoneGap plug-ins to access native features).

The AEM Apps Control Center lets you build and deploy your mobile application, create, and edit application metadata before publishing your mobile application, collaboratively curate and frequently publish fresh and relevant content without the need to revisit the application store submission processes and, analyze application life cycle and usage metrics to improve customer conversion and brand loyalty.

To build your AEM Mobile Application, see the [Building Mobile Applications](/help/mobile/building-app-mobile-phonegap.md) page, in Developers section.

To set up your environment and get started with the Control Center,
