An **AEM developer** extends and creates custom web templates and components to enable the *AEM Author* to create beautiful and engaging mobile experiences. These templates and components are not only optimized for the mobile app world; but communicate both to the device and to the AEM server (any remote server) to omni-channel service end-points. AEM's built-in content editor is used by *AEM Authors* to create rich and relevent experiences within the app, including integration with the rest of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.

An AEM developer is responsible for the following tasks while creating an app using AEM Mobile On-Demand Services:

* [App Templates and Components](/help/mobile/app-templates-and-components1.md)
* [Mobile with Content Sync](/help/mobile/mobile-ondemand-contentsync.md)
* [Content Properties and Content Exporting](/help/mobile/on-demand-content-properties-exporting.md)

See [Developing AEM Mobile Content Services](/help/mobile/developing-content-services.md) for developing Content Services.

>[!NOTE]
>
>An *AEM developer's* role does not start and end with the development of templates and components. An *AEM developer* can create an entirely new app rather than simply extend the out-of-the-box reference implementation sample.
