>[!CAUTION]

>Existing Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Mobile Apps customers migrating from AEM 6.2 or 6.3 to AEM 6.5 can continue to use AEM Mobile Apps by downloading a package from Package Share. However, new installs of AEM 6.5 do not support AEM Mobile Apps functionality.

AEM Mobile is part of the Adobe Experience Manager multi-channel digital platform that also uses AEM Assets, Sites, Screens, Workflow, User Manager, Commerce, and Forms. AEM Mobile offers remarkable deployment flexibility, enabling enterprises to use various content sources.

AEM Mobile offers multiple methods for creating apps. The three different ways that you can create apps are:

* **[Using On-Demand Services with AEM](/help/mobile/getting-started-aem-mobile-on-demand.md)**
* **[Using On-Demand Services without AEM](https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-publishing-solution/help/aem-mobile-end-of-life-faq.html)**
* **[Using Adobe PhoneGap Enterprise with AEM](/help/mobile/getting-started-aem-mobile-phonegap.md)**
