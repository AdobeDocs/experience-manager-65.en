# Spaces and Entities{#spaces-and-entities}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (for example, React). [Learn more](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md).

A Space is a convenient location to store entities that are exposed through the Content Services REST API. This is especially useful because an app (or any channel) can be associated with many entities. Forcing Entities to be within a Space forces the best practice of grouping an App's requirements. Optionally, you can associate an app in AEM with a small number of Spaces.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To make something available to any channel from Content Services, it needs to be under a space.

## Creating a Space {#creating-a-space}

If the user wants to expose a bunch of content and assets to a mobile app, the user creates the space using the AEM Mobile dashboard.

For the first time user, who has not configured content services to work with spaces, the AEM Mobile dashboard displays only Apps after selecting **Content Services**.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>**Prerequisites for adding a space**
>
>Check the **Enable AEM Content Services** to work with Spaces and enable it in your AEM Mobile application dashboard.
>
>See [Administering Content Services](/help/mobile/developing-content-services.md) for more details.

Once you configure Spaces in dashboard, follow these steps to create Spaces:

1. Choose **Spaces** from Content Services.

## Working with Folders in a Space {#working-with-folders-in-a-space}

Spaces can include folders to help further organize space's content and assets. Users can create their own hierarchy under a space.

## Language Copy {#language-copy}

>[!CAUTION]

>Language Copy is not fully functional for this release. It only sets up the structure.

The **Language Copy** feature allows authors to copy their master Language Copy and then create a Project and Workflow to automatically translate the content. Language Copy creates the correct structure. Once you add a folder in a space, you can add Language Copy to your space.

>[!NOTE]

>It is recommended that any content that might be translated, should be placed under the Language Copy node.

### Adding Language Copy {#adding-language-copy}

1. After you create space, click that space to create a language copy.

   Click **Create** and choose **Language Copy**.

   >To navigate into a folder and to see its contents or add a sub folder or entity, click the title of the folder in the space's content list.

## Working with Entities in a Space {#working-with-entities-in-a-space}

Entities represent content that is exposed through the web service endpoint. Entities are stored in spaces so the can be easily found and are kept independent of the AEM repository structure that holds their related content.

You may want to group entities together in some logical gathering. To do so you can create any number of folders.

If entity children, which are other entities, are gathered for data modeling, the developer user may create specific "Group Models" from the "Entity Group" model type, provided out-of-the-box.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Entities are always associated with a space, so most of the entity user interface is accessed through the space console.

### Creating an Entity {#creating-an-entity}

1. Open the Space console and click the title of the space.

   Optionally, you can navigate to the folder by clicking on the title of the folder in the list.

1. Enter a **Title**, **Name**, **Description**, and **Tags** for the entity. Click **Create**.

   ![chlimage_1-94](assets/chlimage_1-94.png)

   Once you are done, the entity appears in your space's descendants.

### Editing an Entity {#editing-an-entity}
