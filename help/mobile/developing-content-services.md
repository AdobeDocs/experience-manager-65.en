AEM Mobile Content Services is a lightweight, feature for requesting content that is managed by AEM. This provides all app developers with a high performing way to retrieve content without having to have deep knowledge of AEM's content repository (JCR) and web framework (Sling). It allows the requesting applications to be decoupled from the content repository.

Content Services introduces several new AEM constructs that allows a developer to access AEM managed content without knoweldge of the repository structure of that content.

These constructs are necessary to maintain flexibility and to enable future expansion by providing an abstraction layer between the AEM managed content and the mobile apps consuming the content. This allows AEM Content Services to work as an abstraction layer between the native applicationâ€™s content requirements and the AEM content repository.

Content Services can deliver the content as assets, packaged HTML (HTML/CSS/JS), or as channel independent content.
