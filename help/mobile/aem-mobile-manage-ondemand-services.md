# Previewing with Preflight {#previewing-with-preflight}

This page explains Previewing with Preflight app.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (e.g. React). [Learn more](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md).

The following actions are performed on the application as a whole.

With the Mobile On Demand Preflight app, you can view all projects to which you have access. Once you select a project, you can then preview the app contents, including browse pages and articles to get a sense of how the app looks and performs on various devices.

>The Preflight app is similar to the PhoneGap Enterprise viewer in nature.
