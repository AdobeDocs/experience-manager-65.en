# Configure your Adobe Mobile Services Cloud Service {#configure-your-adobe-mobile-services-cloud-service}

The **Mobile Metrics Tile** on the command center provides real-time analytics for your mobile application.

The [Adobe Mobile Analytics](https://www.adobe.com/ca/solutions/digital-analytics/mobile-web-apps-analytics.html) SDK is made available through a PhoneGap plug-in. Metrics are collected and cached on the device until the device is connected, at which time the data is pushed to the Adobe Mobile Services Cloud for reporting and analysis.

Adobe Mobile Analytics SDK provides the following:

1. **Data collection for mobile channels** - Collect comprehensive data for your mobile websites and apps on all major operating systems.
1. **Mobile engagement analysis** - Understand user engagement within your mobile app, website, or video, including how frequently consumers launch the channel, whether they make purchases from it, and more.
1. **Mobile app dashboards and reports** - Get usage reports that include lifecycle metrics for your apps and app store metrics â€” see trends for users, launches, average session length, retention length, and crashes.
1. **Mobile campaign analysis** - Quantify the effectiveness of mobile-specific campaigns such as SMS, mobile search ads, mobile display ads, and QR codes.
1. **Geolocation analysis** - Find where your app users launch and interact with your mobile experiences by GPS location or points of interest.
1. **Pathing analysis** - See how users navigate through your app to determine which screens and UI elements are engaging users and which cause users to drop off.
