# PhoneGap{#phonegap}

{{ue-over-mobile}}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Mobile is just one pillar that makes up the complete AEM platform.

Starting a new AEM Mobile app experience requires a cohesion of roles before it is ready for content editing. The following roles provide a starting point for creating a AEM Mobile application:

* **Administrator**
* **Developer**
* **Author**

## Authoring PhoneGap Applications {#authoring-phonegap-applications}

An ***AEM Author* (or *Marketer*)** is able to use the out-of-the-box templates and components to add and edit pages. You can drag and drop components, and add media of all types from the DAM including images, videos, and text fragments (content fragments).
