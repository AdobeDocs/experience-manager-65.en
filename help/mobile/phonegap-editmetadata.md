# Editing App Metadata {#editing-app-metadata}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (for example, React). [Learn more](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md).

The **Manage App** tile and "Manage App" page provides a means to view and edit application metadata. App metadata is required details for releasing an application to a vendor's store. This may include common metadata, iOS metadata and screenshots. See the [Manage App Tile](/help/mobile/phonegap-app-details-tile.md) for further details on common and iOS metadata.

## Editing the App Data {#editing-the-app-data}

To edit the app's metadata:

## Add and Remove Screenshots {#add-and-remove-screenshots}

You can include App screenshots to the metadata roll up. Some vendors require accurate screenshots when submitting any app to their app store. These images must already exist in Assets. See [Asset Picker](../assets/search-assets.md#assetpicker) to upload your screenshots.
