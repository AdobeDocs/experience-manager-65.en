# Cloud Configuration{#cloud-configuration}

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe recommends using the SPA Editor for projects that require single page application framework-based client-side rendering (for example, React). [Learn more](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md).

Associating an On-Demand App to a Cloud Configuration allows Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to communicate directly with a Mobile On-Demand hosted project by establishing a two way link. By linking your app to a Mobile On-Demand project, you will be able to perform content creation, such as articles, banners, and collections within AEM, but also serve that content to Mobile On-Demand.

From there, publishing, previewing, and managing content becomes possible. You can also import existing Mobile On-Demand content into AEM and perform content editing.

## Setting Up Cloud Configuration {#setting-up-cloud-configuration}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Before you start configuring cloud configuration for your On-Demand app, you must be familiar with AEM Mobile Provisioning and Configuring AEM Mobile On-Demand Services Client.

>For details, See [Setting up AEM Mobile On-Demand Services](/help/mobile/aem-mobile-setup.md) in the Administering section.

To configure Mobile On-Demand Cloud Services, click the top gear on the top right corner of the **Manage Connection** tile from your app dashboard.

You should be familiar with the app dashboard and the tiles available. See [AEM Mobile Application Dashboard](/help/mobile/mobile-apps-ondemand-application-dashboard.md) for more details.
