# AEM Adobe PhoneGap{#aem-adobe-phonegap}

{{ue-over-mobile}}

AEM integrates with PhoneGap so that you can easily create apps using AEM pages. PhoneGap let the user create utility apps that let users work with the content. Content Sync enables you to create versioned archives of pages for bundling with apps.

Typically, an ***AEM Administrator*** is responsible for adding a new application to the AEM Mobile catalog, either by creating an app using the creation wizard, or by importing an existing application.

From here an ***AEM Author*** (or *Marketer*) is now able to use the out-of-the-box templates and components to add and edit pages, drag and drop components and add media of all types from the DAM including images, videos and text fragments (content fragments).

The real power of AEM Mobile is that a *savvy* ***AEM Developer*** can extend and create custom web templates and components to enable the *AEM Author* to create beautful and engaging mobile experiences. These templates and components are not only optimized for the mobile app world; but communicate both to the device and to the AEM server (any remote server) to omni-channel service end-points.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the *AEM Author* believes the app is ready, they can first have their stakeholders download the app with **[Adobe Verify](/help/mobile/phonegap-mobile-quickstart.md)** (available in both the AppStore and PlayStore) for review and approval. Once they've received the green light, they are able to release this new or updated content directly to their users through the AEM Mobile ContentSync content release management dashboard. One person can take on any number of roles, that's up to you and your governance policies.
