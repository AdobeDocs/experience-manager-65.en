An ***AEM administrator*** is responsible for adding a new application to the AEM Mobile catalog, either by creating a new app using the creation wizard, or by importing an existing application. AEM administrators who create a new app using AEM Mobile's *creation wizard* typically select one of the desired app templates either from our out-of-the-box reference samples or (in most cases) a custom app template created by *AEM developers.*
