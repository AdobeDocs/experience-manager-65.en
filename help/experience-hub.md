1. In the **Quick access** grouping, click [**Experience Manager**](https://experience.adobe.com).
1. On first access, the system assigns you the **Content Author** preset (seen near the upper-right corner of the page). It controls the widgets, navigation items, and content that you see.

    You can change this preset at any time.

    ![The drop-down list showing the Content Author preset is selected](/help/assets/assets-experience-hub/experience-hub-role-selection.png)

The Adobe Experience Manager page has been refreshed with enhanced navigation and interactive widgets. The previous collection of solution cards provided access to tools like the following: 

* Universal Editor
* Cloud Manager
* Cloud Acceleration Manager
* Software Distribution
* Extension Manager
* Brand Portal

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The widgets, tools, and artifacts shown depend on the user persona, entitlements, and AEM deployment type (AEM as a Cloud Service or Managed Services 6.5/6.5 LTS).

These solutions are now moved to the main navigation under **Tools** or **Services**. Additionally, new navigation elements provide quick access to key Adobe Experience Manager features specific for the solutions that are enabled such as Assets, Sites, Forms, Content Fragments, Launches and many more.

![Experience Hub environments](/help/assets/assets-experience-hub/experience-hub-author-environments-ams.png)

These features are available for the primary production environment that you have access to or you can select a specific environment to target in case you have access to multiple AEM instances.

![Prod and stage environments](/help/assets/assets-experience-hub/experience-hub-prod-stage-ams.png)

Serving as the central hub for Adobe Experience Manager, the Experience Hub page expands to feature additional widgets and actions tailored to each user role (preset). Fully customizable, the page lets you choose the optimal layout for your screen. Widgets can be filtered so that only selected ones appear on the main page, ensuring a personalized experience. 

![Experience Hub customized](/help/assets/assets-experience-hub/experience-hub-custom-ams.png)

Widgets can also be resized and repositioned on the page to suit your needs and preferences better.

![Experience Hub widgets](/help/assets/assets-experience-hub/experience-hub-custom-widgets-ams.png)

The **Authoring Environments** section displays all AEM environments accessible to you, with specific shortcuts for the solutions and pages available for them also letting you pin specific environments that you want displayed at the top of the list.

The **Recents** section, seen in the image below, lists pages you recently visited in AEM. Depending on your tenant's licensing, the widget may include items such as Program, Pipeline Execution, Assets, Page Editor, and Form Editor.

**Quick shortcuts** near the upper-left corner of the page provide a configurable list of shortcuts to help you start daily tasks. The list is customizable, and each action targets the selected AEM environment.
