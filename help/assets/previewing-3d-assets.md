# Previewing 3D assets in AEM{#previewing-3d-assets-aem}

Adobe Experience Manager supports the upload, delivery, and interactive preview of 3D assets as part of the authoring process.

The interactive 3D viewer is available from the asset details page in AEM. The viewer includes, among other things, a collection of interactive camera controls that let you orbit, zoom, and pan the 3D asset.

<!-- See also [Working with 3D assets in Dynamic Media](/help/assets/assets-3d.md). -->

## Supported formats for 3D preview in AEM {#supported-3d-previewing-assets} 

Interactive 3D preview supports the following file formats: 

|3D file extension |File format | MIME type |Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLB |Binary GL Transmission|model/gltf-binary ||
| GLTF |GL Transmission Format|model/gltf+json |See **Note** below. |
| OBJ |WaveFront 3D Object File|application/x-tgif ||
| STL |Stereolithography|application/vnd.ms-pki.stl ||
| DN |Adobe Dimension|model/x-adobe-dn |Support for ingestion only; preview not available.|
| USDZ |Universal Scene Description Zip archive|model/vnd.usdz+zip |Support for ingestion only; preview not available.|

**Note**: If materials do not render in preview of a gLTF model, make sure they are named properly and located in a `textures` folder in the same root folder as the model, similar to the following:

    Asset (folder)
        model.gltf
        model.bin
        textures (folder)
            material_0_baseColor.jpeg
            material_0_normal.jpeg

## Performance considerations when you preview 3D assets in AEM{#performance-3d-previewing-assets}

The time it takes to open a 3D asset in the asset details view page depends on several factors such things as bandwidth, image complexity, and latencies to the server.

In addition, the capabilities of the client computer&mdash;such as a workstation, notebook, or mobile touch device&mdash;are also important to consider when you manipulate the camera interactively. A reasonably powerful system with good graphics capabilities can make the interactive 3D viewing experience smoother and more favorable. 

**To preview 3D assets in AEM**

1. Make sure you have uploaded 3D assets into AEM.
    See [Supported formats for 3D preview](#supported-3d-previewing-assets) and [Uploading assets](/help/assets/manage-assets.md#uploading-assets).
1. From AEM, on the **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** page, tap **[!UICONTROL Assets > Files.]**
