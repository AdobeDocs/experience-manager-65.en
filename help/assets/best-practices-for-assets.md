# Best Practices for Assets {#best-practices-for-assets}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets is a crucial part of delivering high-quality digital marketing experiences that contribute to the achievement of business goals through increasing your content velocity. If you work with a large number of assets within AEM Assets or regularly/periodically upload numerous assets, including videos and dynamic media, optimizing your digital asset management experience is critical for system efficiency.

Depending upon how you have positioned AEM Assets for your organization and the features that you use around asset ingestion, rendition generation, and metadata extraction, identifying and adhering to best practices in different areas greatly enhances system stability and performance under load.

* The [Assets Sizing guide](/help/assets/assets-sizing-guide.md): When drawing up estimates for an Assets implementation, it is important to ensure that there are sufficient resources available in terms of asset storage, CPU, memory, IO and network throughput. Sizing many of these items require understanding how many assets are being loaded into the system. This guide includes best practices that help determine efficient metrics for estimating the infrastructure and resources required for deploying AEM Assets as well as a sizing tool.
