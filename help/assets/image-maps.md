# Add image maps {#adding-image-maps}

Image Maps let you add one or more hyperlinked areas that function like other hyperlinks.

1. Do any one of the following to open **[!UICONTROL In-place Image Editor]**:

   * Using Quick Actions, click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** that appears on an asset in the **[!UICONTROL Card]** view. In the List view, select the asset and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** option in the toolbar.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >Quick Actions is not available in the **[!UICONTROL List]** view.

   * In the **[!UICONTROL Card]** or **[!UICONTROL List]** view, select the asset and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** on the toolbar.
   * Click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** from the asset page.

1. To insert an image map, click **[!UICONTROL Launch Map]** ![image map](assets/do-not-localize/image-map-icon.png) from the toolbar.
1. Select the shape of the image map. The hot-spot of the selected shape is placed on the image.

1. Click the hot-spot, and enter the URL and Alt text. From the **[!UICONTROL Target]** list, specify where you want the image map displayed, for example, the same tab, a new tab, or an iFrame. For example, enter `https://www.adobe.com` as the URL, `Adobe website` as the Alt text, and specify **[!UICONTROL New Tab]** from the **[!UICONTROL Target]** list for the image map to open in a new tab.
