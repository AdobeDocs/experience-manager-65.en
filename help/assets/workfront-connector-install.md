# Install [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] {#assets-integration-overview}

A user with administrator access in [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] installs the enhanced connector. Before you install, review the platform support and other [prerequisites for the connector](https://one.workfront.com/s/csh?context=2467&pubname=the-new-workfront-experience).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe requires deployment and configuration of the [!DNL Adobe Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector] only via certified partners or [!DNL Adobe Professional Services]. If deployed and configured without a certified partner or [!DNL Adobe Professional Services], it is not supported by Adobe.
>
>Adobe may release updates to [!DNL Adobe Workfront] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] that make this connector redundant; if this occurs, customers may be required to transition from the use of this connector.

To install the connector, follow these steps:

1. Download the connector from [[!DNL Software Distribution] link](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/product/assets/workfront-tools.ui.apps.zip).

1. On the dispatcher, allow HTTP headers named `authorization`, `username`, and `apikey`. Allow `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests to `/bin/workfront-tools`.

1. Ensure that the following paths do not exist in [!DNL Experience Manager] repository:

   * `/apps/dam/gui/coral/components/admin/schemaforms/formbuilder`
