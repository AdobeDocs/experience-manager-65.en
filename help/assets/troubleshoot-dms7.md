# Troubleshooting Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode{#troubleshooting-dynamic-media-scene-mode}

The following document describes troubleshooting for Dynamic Media running **dynamicmedia_scene7** run mode.

## Setup and Configuration {#setup-and-configuration}

Ensure that Dynamic Media has been set up properly by doing the following:

* Start up command contains the `-r dynamicmedia_scene7` runmode argument.
* Any AEM 6.4 cumulative fix packs (CFPs) have been installed first *before* any available Dynamic Media Feature Packs.
* Optional Feature Pack 18912 is installed.

  This optional feature pack is for FTP support or if you are migrating assets to Dynamic Media from Dynamic Media Classic.

* Navigate to the Cloud Services user interface and confirm that the provisioned account appears under **[!UICONTROL Available Configurations]**.
* Ensure that the `Dynamic Media Asset Activation (scene7)` replication agent is enabled.

  This replication agent is found under Agents on Author.

## General (All Assets) {#general-all-assets}

The following are some general tips and tricks for all assets.

### Asset Synchronization Status Properties {#asset-synchronization-status-properties}

The following asset properties can be reviewed in CRXDE Lite to confirm the successful synchronization of the asset from AEM to Dynamic Media:

| **Property** |**Example** |**Description** |
|---|---|---|
| `<object_node>/jcr:content/metadata/dam:scene7ID` |**`a|364266`** |General indicator that node is linked to Dynamic Media. |
| `<object_node>/jcr:content/metadata/dam:scene7FileStatus` |**PublishComplete** or error text |Status of upload of asset to Dynamic Media. |
| `<object_node>/jcr:content/metadata/dam:scene7File`  |**myCompany/myAssetID** |Must be populated in order to generate URLs to remote asset of Dynamic Media. |
| `<object_node>/jcr:content/dam:lastSyncStatus` |**success** or **failed: `<error text>`** |Synchronization status of sets (spin sets, image sets, and so on), image presets, viewer presets, image map updates for an asset, or images that were edited. |

### Synchronization Logging {#synchronization-logging}

Synchronization errors and issues are logged in `error.log` (AEM server directory `/crx-quickstart/logs/`). Sufficient logging is available to determine the root cause of most issues, however you can increase the logging to DEBUG on the `com.adobe.cq.dam.ips` package through the Sling Console ([https://localhost:4502/system/console/slinglog](https://localhost:4502/system/console/slinglog)) to gather more information.

### Move, Copy, Delete {#move-copy-delete}

Before performing a Move, Copy, or Delete operation, do the following:

* For images and videos, confirm that a `<object_node>/jcr:content/metadata/dam:scene7ID` value exists before performing move, copy, or delete operations.
* For image and viewer presets, confirm that an `https://<server>/crx/de/index.jsp#/etc/dam/presets/viewer/testpreset/jcr%3Acontent/metadata` value exists before performing move, copy, or delete operations.
* If above metadata value is missing, you need to re-upload assets before move, copy, or delete operations.

### Version Control {#version-control}

When replacing an existing Dynamic Media asset (same name and location), you have the option to keep both assets or replace/create a version:

* Keeping both will create a new asset with a unique name for the published asset URL. For example, `image.jpg` is the original asset and `image1.jpg` is the newly uploaded asset.

* Creating a version is not supported in Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode delivery. The new version will replace the existing asset in delivery.

## Images and Sets {#images-and-sets}

If you are having issues with images and sets, see the following troubleshooting guidance.
