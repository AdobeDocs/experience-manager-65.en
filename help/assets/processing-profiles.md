# Profiles for processing metadata, images, and videos{#profiles-for-processing-metadata-images-and-videos}

A profile is a recipe for what options to apply to assets that get uploaded to a folder. For example, you can specify what metadata profile and video encoding profile to apply to video assets that you upload. Or, what imaging profile to apply to image assets to have them properly cropped.

Those rules can include adding metadata, smart cropping of images, or establishing video encoding profiles. In AEM, you can create three types of profiles, which are covered in detail at the following links:

* [Metadata profiles](/help/assets/metadata-config.md#metadata-profiles)
* [Image profiles](/help/assets/image-profiles.md)
* [Video profiles](/help/assets/video-profiles.md)

You must have Administrator rights to create, edit, and delete metadata, image, or video profiles.

After you create your metadata, image, or video profile, you assign it to one or more folders that you use as the destination for newly uploaded assets.

An important concept regarding the use of profiles in AEM Assets is that they are assigned to folders. Within a profile are settings in the form of metadata profiles, along with video profiles or image profiles. These settings process the contents of a folder along with any of its sub-folders. Therefore, how you name files and folders, how you arrange sub-folders, and how you handle the files within these folders has a significant impact on how those assets are processed by a profile.
By using consistent and appropriate file and folder naming strategies, along with good metadata practice, you can make the most of your digital asset collection and ensure that the right files are processed by the right profile.

>Assets that you move from one folder to another do not get reprocessed. For example, suppose you have Folder 1 that has profile A assigned to it and Folder 2 that has profile B assigned to it. If you move assets from Folder 1 to Folder 2, the moved assets retain their original processing from Folder 1.

## Reprocessing assets in a folder {#reprocessing-assets}

>[!NOTE]

>Applies to *Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode* only in AEM 6.4.6.0 or later.

You can reprocess assets in a folder that already has an existing processing profile that you later changed.

For example, suppose you created an Image profile and assigned it to a folder. Any image assets you uploaded to the folder automatically had the Image profile applied to the assets. However, later you decide to add a new smart crop ratio to the profile. Now, instead of having select and reupload the assets to the folder all over again, you simply run the *Scene7: Reprocess Assets* workflow.

You can run the reprocess workflow on an asset for which processing failed the first time. As such, even if you have not edited a processing profile or applied a processing profile, you can still run the reprocess workflow on a folder of assets any time.

You can optionally adjust the batch size of the reprocess workflow from a default of 50 assets up to 1000 assets. When you run the _Scene7: Reprocess Assets_ workflow on a folder, assets are grouped together in batches, then sent to the Dynamic Media server for processing. Following processing, the metadata of each asset in the entire batch set is updated on AEM. If the batch size is very large, you may experience a delay in processing. Or, if the batch size is too small, it can cause too many round trips to the Dynamic Media server.

See [Adjusting the batch size of the reprocess workflow](#adjusting-load).

>[!NOTE]

>If you are performing a bulk migration of assets from Dynamic Media Classic to AEM, you must enable the Migration replication agent on the Dynamic Media server. When the migration is complete, make sure you disable the agent.
>
>The Migration publish agent must be disabled on the Dynamic Media server so the Reprocess workflow works as expected.

<!-- Batch size is the number of assets that are amalgamated into a single IPS (Dynamic Mediaâ€™s Image Production System) job. When you run the Scene7: Reprocess Assets workflow, the job is triggered on IPS. The number of IPS jobs that are triggered is based on the total number of assets in the folder, divided by the batch size. For example, suppose you had a folder with 150 assets and a batch size of 50. In this case, three IPS jobs are triggered. The assets are updated when the entire batch size (50 in our example) is processed in IPS. The job then moves onto the next IPS job and so on until complete. If you increase the batch size, you may notice a longer delay with assets getting updated. -->

**To reprocess assets in a folder**:
1. In AEM, from the Assets page, navigate to a folder of assets that has a processing profile assigned to it and for which you want to apply the **Scene7: Reprocess Asset** workflow,

    Folders that have a processing profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name in Card View. 

1. Select a folder.

    * The workflow considers all files in the selected folder, recursively.
    * If there are one or more sub-folders with assets in the main selected folder, the workflow will reprocess every asset in the folder hierarchy.
    * As a best practice, you should avoid running this workflow on a folder hierarchy that has more than 1000 assets.

1. Near the upper-left corner of the page, from the drop-down list, click **[!UICONTROL Timeline.]**
1. Near the lower-left corner of the page, to the right of the Comment field, click the carat icon  ( **^** ) .

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow.]**
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Start Workflow]** drop-down list, choose **[!UICONTROL Scene7: Reprocess Assets.]**
1. (Optional) In the **Enter title of workflow** text field, enter a name for the workflow. You can use the name to reference the workflow instance, if necessary.

    ![Reprocess assets 2](/help/assets/assets/reprocess-assets2.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Confirm.]**

    To monitor the workflow or check its progress, from the AEM main console page, click **[!UICONTROL Tools > Workflow.]** On the Workflow Instances page, select a workflow. On the menu bar, click **[!UICONTROL Open History.]** You can also terminate, suspend, or rename a selected workflow from the same Workflow Instances page.

### Adjusting the batch size of the reprocess workflow {#adjusting-load}

(Optional) The default batch size in the reprocessing workflow is 50 assets per job. This optimal batch size is governed by the average asset size and the MIME types of assets on which the reprocess is run. A higher value means you will have many files in a single reprocessing job. Accordingly, the processing banner stays on AEM assets for a longer time. However, if the average file size is small&ndash;1 MB or less&ndash;Adobe recommends that you increase the value to several hundred, but never more than a 1000. If the average file size is large&ndash;hundreds of megabytes&ndash;Adobe recommends that you lower the batch size up to 10.
