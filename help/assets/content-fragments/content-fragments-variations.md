# Variations - Authoring Fragment Content{#variations-authoring-fragment-content}

[Variations](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments.md#constituent-parts-of-a-content-fragment) are a significant feature of AEM's content fragments, as they let you create and edit copies of the master content for use on specific channels, and/or scenarios, making headless content delivery even more flexible.

From the **Variations** tab you can do the following:

* [Enter the content](#authoring-your-content) for your fragment,
* [Create and manage variations](#managing-variations) of the **Master** content,

Perform a range of other actions depending on the data type being edited; for example:

* [Insert visual assets into your fragment](#inserting-assets-into-your-fragment) (images)

* Select between [Rich Text](#rich-text), [Plain Text](#plain-text), and [Markdown](#markdown) for editing

* [Upload Content](#uploading-content)

* [View key statistics](#viewing-key-statistics) (about multi-line text)

* [Summarize Text](#summarizing-text)

* [Synchronize variations with Master content](#synchronizing-with-master)

>[!CAUTION]
>
>After a fragment has been published and/or referenced, AEM displays a warning when an author opens the fragment for editing again. This is to warn that changes to the fragment affect the referenced pages, too.

## Authoring your Content {#authoring-your-content}

When you open your content fragment for editing, the **Variations** tab is opened by default. Here you can author the content, for Master or any variations you have. The structured fragment contains various fields of various data types that were defined in the content model. 

For example:

![full screen editor](assets/cfm-variations-02.png)

You can:

* Make edits to your content directly in the **Variations** tab; each data type provides different editing options, for example:

  * for **Multi line text** fields, you can also open the [full-screen editor](#full-screen-editor) to:

    * select the [Format](#formats)
    * see more editing options (for [Rich Text](#rich-text) format)
    * access a range of [actions](#actions)

  * For **Fragment Reference** fields, the [Edit Content Fragment](#fragment-references-edit-content-fragment) option can be available, depending on the model definition.

* Assign **Tags** to the current variation; the tags can be added, updated, and removed

  * [Tags](/help/sites-authoring/tags.md) are powerful when organizing your fragments as they can be used for content classification and taxonomy. Tags can be used for finding content (by tags) and applying bulk operations. 

    * Searches for a tag return the fragment, with the tag variation highlighted. 
    * Variation tags can also be used to group variations for a specific Content Delivery Network (CDN) profile (for CDN caching), instead of using the variation name. 
  
    For example, you can tag relevant fragments as "Christmas launch" to allow browsing only these as a subset, or to copy them for use with another future launch in a new folder.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >**Tags** can also be added (to the **Master** variation) as part of the [Metadata](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-metadata.md)

* [Create and manage variations](#managing-variations) of the **Master** content.

### Full Screen Editor {#full-screen-editor}

When editing a multi-line text field you can open the full screen editor; click within the actual text, then select the following action icon:

![full screen editor icon](assets/cfm-variations-03.png)

This opens the full-screen text editor:

The full-screen text editor provides:

* Access to various [actions](#actions)
* Depending on the [format](#formats), additional formatting options ([Rich Text](#rich-text))

### Actions {#actions}

The following actions are also available (for all the [formats](#formats)) when the full-screen editor (that is, multi-line text) is open:

* Select the [format](#formats) ([Rich Text](#rich-text), [Plain Text,](#plain-text) [Markdown](#markdown))

* [Upload content](#uploading-content)

* [Show Text Statistics](#viewing-key-statistics)

  * [Annotations](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-variations.md#annotating-a-content-fragment)
* [Insert Content Fragment](#inserting-content-fragment-into-your-fragment); available when your **Multi line text** field is configured with **Allow Fragment Reference**.

The [actions](#actions) are also accessible from the full-screen editor.

### Plain Text {#plain-text}

Plain Text allows for rapid entry of content without formatting or markdown information. You can also open the full-screen editor for further [actions](#actions).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you select **Plain Text**, you might lose any formatting, markdown, and/or assets that you have inserted in either **Rich Text** or **Markdown**.

### Markdown {#markdown}

>[!NOTE]
>
>For full information, see the [Markdown](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-markdown.md) documentation.

This lets you format your text using markdown. You can define:

* Headings
* Paragraphs and Line Breaks
* Links
* Images
* Block Quotes
* Lists
* Emphasis
* Code Blocks
* Backslash Escapes

You can also open the full-screen editor for further [actions](#actions).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you switch between **Rich Text** and **Markdown** you might experience unexpected effects with Block Quotes and Code Blocks, as these two formats can have differences in how they are handled.

### Fragment References {#fragment-references}

If the Content Fragment Model contains Fragment References, your fragment authors may have additional options:

* [Edit Content Fragment](#fragment-references-edit-content-fragment)
* [New Content Fragment](#fragment-references-new-content-fragment)

![Fragment References](assets/cfm-variations-12.png)

#### Edit Content Fragment {#fragment-references-edit-content-fragment}

The option **Edit Content Fragment** opens that fragment in a new window tab.

<!--
The option **Edit Content Fragment** opens that fragment in a new editor tab (within the same browser tab).

Selecting the original tab again (for example, **Little Pony Inc.**), will close this secondary tab (in this case, **Adam Smith**).

![Fragment References](assets/cfm-variations-editreference.png)
--> 

#### New Content Fragment {#fragment-references-new-content-fragment}

The option **New Content Fragment** lets you create a fragment. To achieve this, a variation of the create content fragment wizard opens in the editor. 

You can then create a fragment by:

1. Navigating to, and selecting the required folder.
1. Selecting **Next**.
1. Specifying properties; for example, **Title**.
1. Selecting **Create**.
1. Finally:
   1. **Done** returns (to the original fragment) and references the new fragment.
   1. **Open** references the new fragment and opens the new fragment for editing in a new browser tab.

### Viewing Key Statistics {#viewing-key-statistics}

When the full-screen editor is open, the action **Text Statistics** displays a range of information about the text. 

For example:

![statistics](assets/cfm-variations-04.png)

### Uploading Content {#uploading-content}

To ease the process of authoring content fragments, you can upload text, prepared in an external editor, and add it directly to the fragment.

### Summarizing Text {#summarizing-text}

Summarizing text is designed to help users reduce the length of their text to a predefined number of words, while keeping the key points and overall meaning.

>[!NOTE]
>
>On a more technical level, the system keeps the sentences which it rates as providing the *best ratio of information density and uniqueness* according to specific algorithms.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The content fragment must have a valid language folder (ISO Code) as an ancestor; this is used to determine the language model to be used.
>
>For example, `en/` as in the following path:
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;`/content/dam/my-brand/en/path-down/my-content-fragment`

>[!CAUTION]
>
>English is available out-of-the-box.
>
>Other languages are available as Language Model Packages from Package Share:

  ![annotations](assets/cfm-variations-08.png)

* Can be viewed, and deleted, in the [Timeline](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing.md#timeline-for-content-fragments) for the selected fragment.

### Inserting Assets into your Fragment {#inserting-assets-into-your-fragment}

To ease the process of authoring content fragments, you can add [Assets](/help/assets/manage-assets.md) (images) directly to the fragment.

They are added to the paragraph sequence of the fragment without any formatting; formatting can be done when the [fragment is used/referenced on a page](/help/sites-authoring/content-fragments.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>These assets cannot be moved or deleted on a referencing page, this must be done in the fragment editor.
>
>However, formatting of the asset (for example, size) must be done in the [page editor](/help/sites-authoring/content-fragments.md). The representation of the asset in the fragment editor is purely for authoring the content flow.

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are various methods of adding [images](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments.md#fragments-with-visual-assets) to the fragment and/or page.

1. Position the cursor at the position that you want to add the image.
1. Use the **Insert Asset** icon to open the search dialog.

   ![insert asset icon](assets/cfm-variations-09.png)

1. In the dialog box, you can either:

   * navigate to the required asset in the DAM
   * search for the asset in the DAM

   Once located, select the required asset by clicking the thumbnail.

1. Use **Select** to add the asset to the paragraph system of your content fragment at the current location.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >If you change the format after adding as asset to:
   >
   >* **Plain Text**: the asset is lost from the fragment.
   >* **Markdown**: the asset is not visible, but is still here when you return to **Rich Text**.

### Inserting a Content Fragment into your Fragment {#inserting-content-fragment-into-your-fragment}

To ease the process of authoring content fragments, you can also add another Content Fragment to your fragment.

They are added as a reference, in your current location in your fragment.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This option is available when your **Multi line text** is configured with **Allow Fragment Reference**.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>These assets cannot be moved or deleted on a referencing page, this must be done in the fragment editor.
>
>However, formatting of the asset (for example, size) must be done in the [page editor](/help/sites-authoring/content-fragments.md). The representation of the asset in the fragment editor is purely for authoring the content flow.

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are various methods of adding [images](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments.md#fragments-with-visual-assets) to the fragment and/or page.

1. Position the cursor at the position that you want to add the fragment.
1. Use the **Insert Content Fragment** icon to open the search dialog.

   ![insert Content Fragment icon](assets/cfm-variations-13.png)

1. In the dialog, you can either:

    * navigate to the required fragment in the Assets folder
    * search for the fragment

   Once located, select the required fragment by clicking the thumbnail.

1. Use **Select** to add a reference to the selected Content Fragment to your current content fragment (at the current location).

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >If you change the format, after adding a reference to another fragment, to:
   >
   >* **Plain Text**: the reference is lost from the fragment.
   >* **Markdown**: the reference remains.

## Managing Variations {#managing-variations}

### Creating a Variation {#creating-a-variation}

Variations let you take the **Master** content and vary it according to purpose (if necessary).

To create a variation:

1. Open your fragment and ensure that the side panel is visible.
1. Select **Variations** from the icon bar in the side panel.
1. Select **Create Variation**.
1. A dialog box opens, specify the **Title** and **Description** for the new variation.
1. Select **Add**; the fragment **Master** is copied to the new variation, which is now open for [editing](#editing-a-variation).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When creating a variation, it is always the **Master** that is copied, not the variation that is open.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When you create a variation, all **Tags** currently assigned to the **Master** variation are copied to your new variation. 

### Editing a Variation {#editing-a-variation}

Change the variation content after either:

* [Creating your variation](#creating-a-variation).
* Opening an existing fragment, then selecting the required variation from the side panel.

![editing a variation](assets/cfm-variations-10.png)

### Renaming a Variation {#renaming-a-variation}

To rename an existing variation:

1. Open your fragment and select **Variations** from the side panel.
1. Select the required variation.
1. Select **Rename** from the **Actions** drop-down.

1. Enter the new **Title** and/or **Description** in the resulting dialog box.

1. Confirm the **Rename** action.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This only affects the variation **Title**.

### Deleting a Variation {#deleting-a-variation}

To delete an existing variation:

1. Open your fragment and select **Variations** from the side panel.
1. Select the required variation.
1. Select **Delete** from the **Actions** drop-down.

1. Confirm the **Delete** action in the dialog.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot delete **Master**.

### Synchronizing with Master {#synchronizing-with-master}

**Master** is a part of a content fragment and, by definition, it holds the master copy of the content, whereas the variations hold the individual updated and tailored versions of that content. When the Master is updated, it is possible that these changes are also relevant to the variations and, therefore, must be propagated to them.

When editing a variation, you have access to the action for synchronizing the current element of the variation with Master. This lets you automatically copy changes made to Master to the required variation.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Synchronization is only available to copy changes *from **Master** to the variation*.
>
>Only the current element of the variation is synchronized.
>
>Synchronization only works on the **Multi line text** data type.
>
>Transferring changes *from a variation to **Master*** is not available as an option.

<!-- needs new screenshot for synchronize effect -->

1. Open your content fragment in the fragment editor. Ensure that the **Master** has been edited.

1. Select a specific variation, then the appropriate synchronization action from either:

   * the **Actions** drop-down selector - **Sync current element with master**

      ![synchronizing with master](assets/cfm-variations-11a.png)

   * the toolbar of the full-screen editor - **Sync with master**

      ![synchronizing with master](assets/cfm-variations-11b.png)

1. Master and the variation are shown side-by-side:

   * green indicates that content added (to the variation)
   * red indicates content removed (from the variation)
   * blue indicates replaced text

   ![synchronizing with master](assets/cfm-variations-11c.png)

1. Select **Synchronize**, the variation is updated and shown.
