# Content Fragment Structure Tree {#content-fragment-structure-tree}

Use the Structure Tree feature of the Content Fragment Editor in AEM to better understand your headless content.

In the Content Fragment Editor you can select the Structure Tree icon:

![Content Fragment Structure Tree](assets/cfm-structuretree-01.png)

This opens a representation of the fragment's structure in the left hand pane. Using this you can navigate through, and to, referenced fragments. Selecting a reference opens that fragment for editing.

>[!NOTE]

>Using the breadcrumbs in the main panel you can navigate back to your starting point.
