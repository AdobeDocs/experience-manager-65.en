# Share asset via a link {#asset-link-sharing}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] lets you share assets, folders, and collections as a URL with members of your organization and external entities, including partners and vendors. Sharing assets through a link is a convenient way of making resources available to external parties without them having to first log in to [!DNL Assets].

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>* You require Edit ACL permission on the folder or the asset that you want to share as a link.
>* To send emails to the users, configure the SMTP server details in [Day CQ Mail Service](#configmailservice).

## Share assets {#sharelink}

To generate the URL for assets that you want to share with users, use the Link Sharing dialog. Users with administrator privileges or with read permissions at `/var/dam/share` location are able to view the links shared with them.

1. In the [!DNL Assets] user interface, select the asset to share as a link.
1. From the toolbar, click the **[!UICONTROL Share Link]** ![share assets icon](assets/do-not-localize/assets_share.png).

   The link that will be created after clicking [!UICONTROL Share] is displayed in advance in the [!UICONTROL Share Link] field. The default expiration time for the link is one day.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you want to share links from your [!DNL Experience Manager] Author deployment to external entities, ensure that you only expose the following URLs (which are used for link sharing) for `GET` requests only. Block other URLs for security reasons.
   >
   >* `http://[aem_server]:[port]/linkshare.html`
   >* `http://[aem_server]:[port]/linksharepreview.html`
   >* `http://[aem_server]:[port]/linkexpired.html`

1. In [!DNL Experience Manager] interface, access **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Operations]** > **[!UICONTROL Web Console]**.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Day CQ Link Externalizer]** configuration and modify the following properties in the **[!UICONTROL Domains]** field with the values mentioned against `local`, `author`, and `publish`. For the `local` and `author` properties, provide the URL for the local and the author instance respectively. Both `local` and `author` properties have the same value if you run a single [!DNL Experience Manager] author instance. For Publish instances, provide the URL for the [!DNL Experience Manager] publish instance.

1. In the email address box of the **[!UICONTROL Link Sharing]** dialog, type the email ID of the user you want to share the link with. You can add one or more users.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Share]**. A message confirms that the link is shared with the users via an email.

   ![chlimage_1-263](assets/chlimage_1-548.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Configure maximum data size {#maxdatasize}

When you download assets from the link shared using the Link Sharing feature, [!DNL Experience Manager] compresses the asset hierarchy from the repository and then returns the asset in a ZIP file. However, in the absence of limits to the amount of data that can be compressed in a ZIP file, huge amounts of data is subjected to compression, which causes out of memory errors in JVM. To secure the system from a potential denial of service attack due to this situation, configure the maximum size using the **[!UICONTROL Max Content Size (uncompressed)]** parameter for [!UICONTROL Day CQ DAM Adhoc Asset Share Proxy Servlet] in Configuration Manager. If uncompressed size of the asset exceeds the configured value, asset download requests are rejected. The default value is 100 MB.

1. Click the [!DNL Experience Manager] logo and then go to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Operations]** > **[!UICONTROL Web Console]**.
1. From the Web Console, locate the **[!UICONTROL Day CQ DAM Adhoc Asset Share Proxy Servlet]** configuration.
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Day CQ DAM Adhoc Asset Share Proxy Servlet]** configuration in edit mode, and modify the value of the **[!UICONTROL Max Content Size (uncompressed)]** parameter.

1. Save the changes.

## Best practices and troubleshooting {#bestpractices}

* Asset folders or Collections that contain a whitespace in their name may not get shared.
* If users cannot download the shared assets, check with your [!DNL Experience Manager] administrator what the [download limits](#maxdatasize) are.
* If you cannot send email with links to shared assets or if the other users cannot receive your email, check with your [!DNL Experience Manager] administrator if the [email service](#configmailservice) is configured or not.
* If you cannot share assets using link sharing functionality, ensure that you have the appropriate permissions. See [share assets](#sharelink).
* If a shared asset is moved to a different location, its link stops working. Re-create the link and re-share with the users.
