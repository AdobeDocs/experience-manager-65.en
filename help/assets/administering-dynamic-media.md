# Setting Up Dynamic Media {#setting-up-dynamic-media}

[Dynamic Media](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/assets/dynamic-media.html) helps you manage assets by delivering rich visual merchandising and marketing assets on demand, automatically scaled for consumption on web, mobile, and social sites. Using a set of primary source assets, Dynamic Media generates and delivers multiple variations of rich content in real time through its global, scalable, performance-optimized network.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This documentation describes Dynamic Media capabilities, which are integrated directly into Adobe Experience Manager. If you are using Dynamic Media Classic integrated into Experience Manager, see [Dynamic Media Classic integration documentation](/help/sites-administering/scene7.md).
>
>See [Dual Use Scenario](/help/sites-administering/scene7.md#dual-use-scenario) for times when you want to use Experience Manager integrated with Dynamic Media Classic along with Dynamic Media.

>**If you are upgrading:**
>
>* After you have Experience Manager up and running, any asset you upload has Dynamic Media automatically enabled (unless it was explicitly disabled by your system administrator). If you are on an upgraded instance of Experience Manager and new to Dynamic Media, you must reprocess your assets to make them Dynamic Media-enabled.
