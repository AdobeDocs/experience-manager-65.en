# Create translation projects {#creating-translation-projects}

To create a language copy, trigger one of the following language copy workflows available under the References rail in the [!DNL Experience Manager] user interface.

* **Create and translate**: In this workflow, assets to be translated are copied to the language root of the language to which you want to translate. In addition, depending upon the options you choose, a translation project is created for the assets in the Projects console. Depending on the settings, the translation project can be started manually or allowed to run automatically as soon as the translation project is created.

* **Update language copies**: Run this workflow to translate an additional group of assets and include it in a language copy for a particular locale. In this case, the translated assets are added to the target folder that already contains previously translated assets.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>* Users who create translation projects are members of the group `projects-administrators`.
>* Translation service provider supports the translation of binaries.

## Create and translate workflow {#create-and-translate-workflow}

You use the create and translate workflow to generate language copies for a particular language for the first time. The workflow provides the following options:

* Create structure only.
* Create a translation project.
* Add to existing translation project.

### Create structure only {#create-structure-only}

Use the **[!UICONTROL Create structure only]** option to create a target folder hierarchy within the target language root to match the hierarchy of the source folder within the source language root. In this case, source assets are copied to the destination folder. However, no translation project is generated.

1. In the [!DNL Assets] interface, select the source folder for which you want to create a structure in the target language root.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL References]** pane and click **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** under **[!UICONTROL Copies]**.

   ![Language copies](assets/translation-language-copies.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create & Translate]**. From the **[!UICONTROL Target Languages]** list, select the language for which you want to create a folder structure.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Project]** list, choose **[!UICONTROL Create structure only]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. The new structure for the target language is listed under **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]**.

   ![language copies](assets/lang-copy2.png)

1. Click the structure from the list, and then click **[!UICONTROL Reveal in Assets]** to navigate to the folder structure within the target language.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This feature is available both for assets and folders. When an asset is selected instead of a folder, the entire hierarchy of folders up to the language root is copied to create a language copy for the asset.

### Add to existing translation project {#add-to-existing-translation-project}

If you use this option, the translation workflow runs for assets that you add to the source folder after running a previous translation workflow. Only the newly-added assets are copied to the target folder that contains previously translated assets. No new translation project is created in this case.

## Create temporary language copies {#creating-temporary-language-copies}

When you run a translation workflow to update a language copy with edited versions of original assets, the existing language copy is preserved until you approve the translated assets. [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] stores the newly-translated assets at a temporary location and updates the existing language copy after you explicitly approve the assets. If you reject the assets, the language copy remains unchanged.

1. Click the source root folder under **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** for which you already created a language copy, and then click **[!UICONTROL Reveal in Assets]** to open the folder in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets].

   ![chlimage_1-99](assets/chlimage_1-99.png)

1. From the [!DNL Assets] interface, select an asset you already translated and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** from the toolbar to open the asset in edit mode.
1. Edit the asset and then save the changes.
1. Perform steps 2-14 of the [Add to existing translation project](#add-to-existing-translation-project) procedure to update the language copy.
1. Click the ellipsis at the bottom of the **[!UICONTROL Translation Job]** tile. From the list of assets in the **[!UICONTROL Translation Job]** page, you can clearly view the temporary location where the translated version of the asset is stored.

   ![chlimage_1-101](assets/chlimage_1-101.png)

1. Select the checkbox next to **[!UICONTROL Title]**.
1. From the toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Accept Translation]** ![accept translation](assets/do-not-localize/thumb-up.png) and then click **[!UICONTROL Accept]** in the dialog to overwrite the translated asset in the target folder with the translated version of the edited asset.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To enable the translation workflow to update the destination assets, accept both the asset and metadata.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Reject Translation]** ![reject translation](assets/do-not-localize/thumb-down.png) to retain the originally translated version of the asset in the target locale root and reject the edited version.

1. To view the translated metadata, navigate to the [!DNL Assets] console and open the [!UICONTROL Properties] page for each of the translated assets.

## Tips and limitations {#tips-limitations}

* If you launch a translation workflow for complex assets, such as PDF and [!DNL Adobe InDesign] files, their subassets or renditions (if any) are not submitted for translation.
* If you use machine translation, the asset binaries are not translated.
