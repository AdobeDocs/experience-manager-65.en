[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets] lets you automate translation workflows on assets (including binaries, metadata, and tags) to generate assets in other languages for use in multilingual projects.

To automate translation workflows, you integrate translation service providers with [!DNL Experience Manager] and create projects for translating assets into multiple languages. [!DNL Experience Manager] supports human and machine translation workflows.

Human translation: The translated assets are returned and imported into [!DNL Experience Manager]. When your translation provider is integrated with [!DNL Experience Manager], assets are automatically sent between [!DNL Experience Manager] and the translation provider.

Machine translation: The machine translation service immediately translates the metadata and tags for assets.

Translating assets includes the following:

1. [Connect Experience Manager with the translation service provider](/help/sites-administering/tc-tic.md#connecting-to-a-translation-service-provider)
1. [Create translation integration framework configurations](/help/sites-administering/tc-tic.md)
1. [Prepare assets for translation](preparing-assets-for-translation.md)
1. [Apply translation cloud services to folders](transition-cloud-services.md)
1. [Create translation projects](translation-projects.md)

If your translation service provider does not provide a connector to integrate with [!DNL Experience Manager], use an [alternative process](/help/sites-administering/tc-manage.md#exporting-a-translation-job).
