# Configure selective publishing at the folder level in Dynamic Media {#selective-publish-configure-folder}

You can choose to publish or unpublish assets to or from Adobe Experience Manager or Dynamic Media at the folder level. You can use either **[!UICONTROL Manage Publication]** or **[!UICONTROL Quick Publish]** instead of relying solely on the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]** whose settings are global to all folders across your Dynamic Media instance.

For example, with selective publishing you can work on assets for products that are not yet live. In such a case, a marketing team can access smart crop images and dynamic renditions that are synched to Dynamic Media. They can create promotional materials, all without the need to publish those assets to Dynamic Media for global delivery.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Selective Publish is only available in Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>*Copying* assets to and from folders clears the publish state of those assets. However, when you *move* assets to and from folders whose folder property is set to **[!UICONTROL Selective Publish]**, the publish state of those assets is maintained.

If you decide later to change the **[!UICONTROL Selective Publish]** settings in a folder, those changes affect only new assets that you upload to that folder from that point forward. The publish state of existing assets in the folder remain as-is until you manually change them from either **[!UICONTROL Quick Publish]** or the **[!UICONTROL Manage Publication]** dialog box.

The folder level **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Publish mode]** option always defaults to the value that is found in the **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets]** setting in your **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]**. The following steps in this topic, however, show you how to manually change this default value at the folder level (as described in the following steps) to override the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]** value.

Regardless of whether you rely on either of the following:

* **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets]** value set in **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]**.
* **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Publish mode]** value set in folder level properties.

You can choose **[!UICONTROL Immediately]**, **[!UICONTROL On Activation]**, or **[!UICONTROL Selective Publish]**. For example, you can set the **[!UICONTROL Publish Assets]** value in your **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]** to **[!UICONTROL On Activation]**, but set the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Publish]** mode value at the folder level to **[!UICONTROL Selective Publish]**, and conversely.

After you configure selective publishing in a folder, you can do any of the following:

* [Selectively publish assets to Dynamic Media or Experience Manager using Manage Publication](#selective-publish-manage-publication).
* [Selectively unpublish assets from Dynamic Media or Experience Manager using Manage Publication](#selective-unpublish-manage-publication).
* [Publish assets to Dynamic Media or Experience Manager using Quick Publish](#quick-publish-aem-dm).
* [Selectively publish or unpublish assets by way of search results](#selective-publish-unpublish-search-results).

**To configure selective publishing at the folder level in Dynamic Media:**

1. In Experience Manager, select the Experience Manager logo to access the global navigation console. On the left side, select the Navigation icon (just above the Tools icon), then select **[!UICONTROL Assets]** > **[!UICONTROL Files]**.
1. Do one of the following:
    * Edit the properties of an existing folder - In **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, **[!UICONTROL Column View]**, or **[!UICONTROL List View]**, navigate to a folder whose properties you want to edit. Select the folder, then on the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.
    * Edit the properties of a new folder - In **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, **[!UICONTROL Column View]**, or **[!UICONTROL List View]**, near the upper-right corner of the page, select **[!UICONTROL Create]** > **[!UICONTROL Folder]**. In the **[!UICONTROL Create Folder]** dialog box, enter a title (required) for the folder, then select **[!UICONTROL Create]**. Select the folder, then on the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Sync mode]** drop-down list, select one of the following:

    | Sync mode | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **[!UICONTROL Inherited]** | No explicit sync value on the folder; instead, the folder inherits the sync value from one of its ancestor folders or the default mode set in your **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]**. The detailed status for **[!UICONTROL Inherited]** shows by way of a tool tip. |
    | **[!UICONTROL Sync everything in this folder subtree to Dynamic Media]** | For publishing to Dynamic Media to succeed, assets must be synced to Dynamic Media. Selecting this option includes all assets in this subtree for synchronizing to Dynamic Media. The folder-specific settings override the default setting in the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]**. |
    | **[!UICONTROL Exclude everything in this folder subtree from Dynamic Media sync]** | Exclude all assets in this subtree from synchronizing to Dynamic Media. |

    ![Folder level selective publish](/help/assets/assets-dm/createfolder-properties-selectivepublish.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Publish mode]** drop-down list, select an option. The **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Publish mode]** option always defaults to the value that is set in the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]**. You can, however, manually override this default **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Configuration]** value by using one of the following options.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >Regardless of the Dynamic Media Publish mode option you select, any updates you later make to an asset that is *already* published, those updates are immediately published without any further user action.
    >
    >If a published video is updated, it must be published again to reflect changes on delivery.

    | Dynamic Media Publish mode option | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **[!UICONTROL Immediately]** | When assets are uploaded to this folder, the system ingests the assets into Experience Manager and provides the URL/Embed instantly. This option is tied to Experience Manager publishing only and there is no user intervention necessary to publish assets.<br>This option is *not* available if you selected **[!UICONTROL Exclude everything in this folder subtree from Dynamic Media sync]** in **[!UICONTROL Sync mode]** in the previous step. |
    | **[!UICONTROL Upon Activation]** | When assets are uploaded to this folder, you must explicitly publish the asset first before a URL/Embed link is provided. This option is tied to Experience Manager publishing only.<br>This option is *not* available if you selected **[!UICONTROL Exclude everything in this folder subtree from Dynamic Media sync]** in **[!UICONTROL Sync mode]** in the previous step. |
    | **[!UICONTROL Selective Publish]** | Assets are published to your choice of either Experience Manager or to Dynamic Media for delivery in the public domain. Both publishing methods are mutually exclusive of each other. That is, you can publish assets to DMS7 so you can use features such as Smart Crop or dynamic renditions. Or, you can publish assets exclusively to Experience Manager for secure previewing; those same assets are *not* published to DMS7 for delivery in the public domain. This option is not available if you selected **[!UICONTROL Exclude everything in this folder subtree from Dynamic Media sync]** in **[!UICONTROL Sync mode]** in the previous step. |

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, select **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]**, then select **[!UICONTROL OK]** to return to Experience Manager Assets.

1. Select an asset so it appears with a checkmark. See screenshot below for example.
1. Near the upper-left corner of the page, from the drop-down menu, select **[!UICONTROL Timeline]**. The **[!UICONTROL Status]** region in the left-panel shows the publish state of the selected asset.
When you use **[!UICONTROL List View]**, an extra column for **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media]** publish state appears.
    * A folder that is configured to sync to Dynamic Media displays the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media]** column by default.
    * A folder that is *not* configured to sync to Dynamic Media does not display the Dynamic Media column.
    ![List View and Timeline](/help/assets/assets-dm/selective-publish-status-timeline.png)

## Troubleshoot Selective Publish {#selective-publish-troubleshoot}

An asset that is not synced to Dynamic Media but has a Dynamic Media publish action triggered on it results in the following error message and solution:
