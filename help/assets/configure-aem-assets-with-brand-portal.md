| AEM 6.5     | This article         |

Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal lets you publish approved brand assets from Adobe Experience Manager Assets to Brand Portal and distribute them to the Brand Portal users.

AEM Assets is configured with Brand Portal via Adobe Developer Console, which procures an Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) account token for authorization of the Brand Portal tenant.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Configuring AEM Assets with Brand Portal via Adobe Developer Console is supported on AEM 6.5.4.0 and above.
>
<!--
>Earlier, Brand Portal was configured via legacy OAuth Gateway, which uses the JSON Web Token (JWT) exchange to obtain an IMS Access token for authorization. 
>
>Configuration via legacy OAuth Gateway is no longer supported from April 6, 2020, and is changed to Adobe Developer Console.
-->

>[!TIP]
>
>***For existing customers only*** 
>
>Adobe recommends that you continue to use the existing legacy OAuth Gateway configuration. If you encounter problems with legacy OAuth Gateway configuration, delete the existing configuration and create a configuration by way of the Adobe Developer Console.

<!--
This help describes the following two use-cases:

* [New configuration](#configure-new-integration-65): If you are a new Brand Portal user and want to configure your AEM Assets Author instance with Brand Portal, you can create a configuration by way of the Adobe Developer Console. 
* [Upgrade configuration](#upgrade-integration-65): If you are an existing Brand Portal user having configuration on legacy OAuth Gateway, delete the existing configuration and create a configuration by way of Adobe Developer Console.
-->
The information provided is based on the assumption that anyone reading this Help is familiar with the following technologies:

* Installing, configuring, and administering Adobe Experience Manager and AEM packages.

* Using Linux&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Windows operating systems.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You require the following to configure AEM Assets with Brand Portal:

* An up and running AEM Assets Author instance with the latest Service Pack
* A Brand Portal tenant URL
* A user with system administrator privileges on the IMS organization of the Brand Portal tenant

1. [Configure an IMS account](#create-ims-account-configuration)
1. [Configure cloud service](#configure-cloud-service)
1. [Test configuration](#test-integration)
-->
<!--
### Create IMS configuration {#create-ims-configuration}

The IMS configuration authenticates your AEM Assets Author instance with the Brand Portal tenant. 

IMS configuration includes two steps:

* [Obtain a public certificate](#public-certificate) 
* [Configure an IMS account](#create-ims-account-configuration)

### Obtain public certificate {#public-certificate}

The public key (certificate) authenticates your profile on Adobe Developer Console.

1. Log in to your AEM Assets Author instance. The default URL is `http://localhost:4502/aem/start.html`.

1. From the **Tools** ![Tools](assets/do-not-localize/tools.png) panel, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Security]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Configurations]**.

1. In the Adobe IMS Configurations page, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. It redirects to the **[!UICONTROL Adobe IMS Technical Account Configuration]** page. By default, the **Certificate** tab opens.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Brand Portal]** in the **[!UICONTROL Cloud Solution]** dropdown list.  

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Create new certificate]** check box and specify an **alias** for the public key. The alias serves as the name of the public key. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create certificate]**. Then, click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to generate the public key.

   ![Create Certificate](assets/ims-config2.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Download Public Key]** icon and save the public key (.crt) file on your machine. 

   The public key is used later to configure the API for your Brand Portal tenant and generate service account credentials in Adobe Developer Console.

   ![Download Certificate](assets/ims-config3.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**. 

   In the **Account** tab, an Adobe IMS account is created which requires the service account credentials that are generated in Adobe Developer Console. Keep this page open for now.

   Open a new tab and [create a service account (JWT) connection in Adobe Developer Console](#createnewintegration) so you can get the credentials and JWT payload for configuring the IMS account. 

### Create the service account (JWT) connection {#createnewintegration}

In Adobe Developer Console, projects and APIs are configured at the Brand Portal tenant (organization) level. Configuring an API creates a service account (JWT) connection. There are two methods to configure the API, by generating a key pair (private and public keys) or by uploading a public key. To configure AEM Assets with Brand Portal, you must generate a public key (certificate) in AEM Assets and create credentials in Adobe Developer Console by uploading the public key. These credentials are required to configure the IMS account in AEM Assets. Once the IMS account is configured, you can configure the Brand Portal cloud service in AEM Assets.

To create the service account credentials and JWT payload, do the following:

1. Log in to Adobe Developer Console with system administrator privileges on the IMS organization (Brand Portal tenant). The default URL is [https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui).


   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Ensure that you have selected the correct IMS organization (Brand Portal tenant) from the drop-down (organization) list in the upper-right corner.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create new project]**. A blank project with a system-generated name is created for your organization. 

   Click **[!UICONTROL Edit project]** so you can update the **[!UICONTROL Project Title]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]**, and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
   
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Project overview]** tab, click **[!UICONTROL Add API]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Add an API window]**, select **[!UICONTROL AEM Brand Portal]** and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**. 

   Ensure that you have access to the AEM Brand Portal service.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Configure API]** window, click **[!UICONTROL Upload your public key]**. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Select a File]** and upload the public key (.crt file) that you have downloaded in the [obtain public certificate](#public-certificate) section. 

   Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

   ![Upload Public Key](assets/service-account3.png)

1. Verify the public key and click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Assets Brand Portal]** as the default product profile and click **[!UICONTROL Save configured API]**. 
-->
   <!-- 
   In Brand Portal, a default profile is created for each organization. The Product Profiles are created in admin console for assigning users to groups (based on the roles and permissions). For configuration with Brand Portal, the OAuth token is created at organization level. Therefore, you must configure the default Product Profile for your organization. 
   -->
<!--
   ![Select Product Profile](assets/service-account4.png)

1. Once the API is configured, you are redirected to the API overview page. From the left navigation under **[!UICONTROL Credentials]**, click the **[!UICONTROL Service Account (JWT)]** option.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You can view the credentials and perform actions such as generate JWT tokens, copy credential details, and retrieve client secret.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Client Credentials]** tab, copy the **[!UICONTROL client ID]**. 

   Click **[!UICONTROL Retrieve Client Secret]** and copy the **[!UICONTROL client secret]**.

   ![Service Account Credentials](assets/service-account5.png)

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Generate JWT]** tab and copy the **[!UICONTROL JWT Payload]** information. 

You can now use the client ID (API key), client secret, and JWT payload to [configure the IMS account](#create-ims-account-configuration) in AEM Assets.

<!--
### Create Adobe I/O integration {#createnewintegration}

Adobe I/O integration generates API Key, Client Secret, and Payload (JWT) which is required in setting up the IMS Account configurations.
