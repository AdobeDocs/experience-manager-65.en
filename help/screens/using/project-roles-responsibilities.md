# Part 1: Project Roles and Responsibilities{#part-project-roles-and-responsibilities}

This page highlights part 1 of a 5-part series designed to help team members better understand roles, responsibilities and time lines required during the sales and project life cycles for a digital signage project.

## Overview {#overview}

The following tutorial covers Project Roles & Responsibilities for Adobe, AEM Implementors and AV Integrators at a high-level. You can navigate to subsequent episodes to get a comprehensive overview for how to successfully develop AEM Screens opportunities and position deployments for long-term success.

There are 3 primary groups that are engaged through the delivery process within:

* Adobe
* A/V Integrator
* AEM Implementation Team

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is important that all involved understand exactly how each party factors into the AEM Screens deployment and issue resolution workflows, with clearly defined roles in addressing performance issues.

## Summary of Roles Involved in a Digital Signage Project {#summary-of-roles-involved-in-a-digital-signage-project}

Defining application use-case parameters in partnership with Adobe, AEM Implementor and AV Integrator will drive software development scope. This ensures a phased approach that establishes with performance benchmarks and success metrics identified throughout the project.

#### Adobe {#adobe}

Adobe includes Adobe Managed Services resources like the CSE (Customer Success Engineer) and Adobe Support.

#### AEM Implementors {#aem-implementors}

**AEM Implementors **are responsible for performing development and integration tasks to develop the user experience, custom templates, and back-end integrations for AEM.

Custom features required to address end-customer UX (User Experience) parameters are also captured and delivered through this process.

AEM Implementors will typically deploy custom functionality in phases over time to locations. For example, they might first establish support for playback of basic looped video or static graphic content. The next phase might include enabling the ability to support playback of localized content through dynamic templates and metadata tags, with additional phases incorporating support for interactive elements via touch screens, sensors, dynamic triggers, and so on.

#### AV Integrators {#av-integrators}

An **AV Integrator** is responsible for conducting discovery with end-customers to define requirements determining project scope to design, build and effectively manage deployments around digital signage hardware.

## The Next Step {#the-next-step}

Once you understand what are the project roles and responsibilities in implementing a digital signage project, follow the next tutorial that dives deep into topics such as testing and pre-sales considerations as the project is scoped when developing AEM Screens opportunities.
