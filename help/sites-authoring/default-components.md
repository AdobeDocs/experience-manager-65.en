## General Usage {#general-usage}

The components are available on the **Components** tab of the side panel of the page editor when [editing a page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md).

For more information about adding components to a page, see [Editing Page Content](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md).
Components are sorted according to various categories called component groups. Examples of such component groups include:

* **We.Retail Commerce**: Includes commerce components such as carts and product grids
