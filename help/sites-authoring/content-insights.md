# Content Insight{#content-insight}

Content Insight provides information about page performance using web analytics and SEO recommendations. Use Content Insight to make decisions about how to modify pages, or to learn how previous changes have changed performance. For every page that you author, you can open Content Insight to analyse the page.

The layout of the Content Insight page changes to suit the screen dimensions and orientation of the device that you are using.

## Report Data

The Content Insight page includes reports that use Adobe SiteCatalyst, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, and BrightEdge data:

* SiteCatalyst: Reports for the following metrics are available:

    * Page views
    * Average time spent on page
    * Sources

* Target: Reports on campaign activity for which your page includes offers.
* BrightEdge: Reports on the page features that improve the visibility of the page to search engines, and recommends features that should be implemented.

See [Opening Analytics and Recommendations for a Page](/help/sites-authoring/ci-analyze.md#opening-analytics-and-recommendations-for-a-page).

## Reporting Period

Reports show data for a period of time that you control. When you adjust the reporting period, the reports automatically refresh with data for that period. Visual cues indicate the time when page versions changed, so that you can compare the performance of each version.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The timeline for the Content Insight dashboard is in `GMT`.

You can also specify the granularity of the reported data, for example, you can see daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly data.

See [Changing the Reporting Period](/help/sites-authoring/ci-analyze.md#changing-the-reporting-period).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Content Insights reports require that your administrator has integrated AEM with SiteCatalyst, Target, and BrightEdge. See [Integrating with SightCatalyst](/help/sites-administering/adobeanalytics.md), [Integrating with Adobe Target](/help/sites-administering/target.md), and [Integrating with BrightEdge](/help/sites-administering/brightedge.md).

## The SEO Recommendations Report {#the-seo-recommendations-report}

The SEO Recommendations report contains the results of the BrightEdge analysis for the page. The report is a checklist of page features that indicates which features the page does and does not include for maximizing the findability using search engines.
