# Quick Guide to Authoring Pages{#quick-guide-to-authoring-pages}

These procedures are intended as a quick guide (high-level) to the key actions of authoring page content in AEM.

They:

* Are not intended as comprehensive coverage.
* Provide links to the detailed documentation.

For full details about authoring with AEM see:

* [First Steps for Authors](/help/sites-authoring/first-steps.md)
* [Authoring Pages](/help/sites-authoring/page-authoring.md)

## A Few Quick Hints {#a-few-quick-hints}

Before giving the overview of specifics, here is a small collection of general tips and hints that are worth bearing in mind.

### Sites Console {#sites-console}

* **Create**

    * This button is available in many consoles - the options presented are context-sensitive so can vary according to the scenario.

* Reordering pages in a folder

    * This can be done in [List View](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#list-view). The changes are applied and visible in other views.

#### Page Authoring {#page-authoring}

* Navigating Links

    * ***Links are not available for navigation*** when you are in **Edit** mode. To navigate with links, you need to [preview the page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#previewing-pages) using either:

        * [Preview Mode](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#preview-mode)
        * [View as Published](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#view-as-published)

* Versions are not started/created from the page editor; this is now done from the Sites console (via either **Create** or [Timeline](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#timeline) for a selected resource).

>[!NOTE]

>There are several keyboard shortcuts that can make the authoring experience easier.

### Finding Your Page {#finding-your-page}

There are various aspects to finding a page; you can navigate and/or search:

1. Open the **Sites** console (using the **Sites** option in the [Global Navigation](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#global-navigation)) - this is triggered (drop-down) when you select the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left).

1. Navigate down the tree by tapping/clicking on the appropriate page. How the page resources are represented depends on the view you are using - [Card, List, or Column](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources):

   ![screen_shot_2018-03-21at160214](assets/screen_shot_2018-03-21at160214.png)

1. Navigate up the tree using [the breadcrumb in the header](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#theheaderwithbreadcrumbs), which lets you return to the selected location:

   ![qgtap-01](assets/qgtap-01.png)

1. You can also [Search](/help/sites-authoring/search.md) for a page. You can select your page from the results shown.

   ![qgtap-03](assets/qgtap-03.png)

### Creating a New Page {#creating-a-new-page}

To [create a page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#creating-a-new-page):

1. [Navigate to the location](#finding-your-page) where you want to create the page.
1. Use the **Create** icon and then select **Page** from the list:

   ![qgtap-02](assets/qgtap-02.png)

1. This opens the wizard that will guide you through collecting the information needed when [creating your new page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#creating-a-new-page). Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Selecting Your Page for Further Action {#selecting-your-page-for-further-action}

You can select a page so that you can take action on it. Selecting a page will automatically update the toolbar so that the actions relevant to that resource are shown.

How to select a page depends on which view you are using in the console:

1. Column View:

    * Click the thumbnail for the required resource - the thumbnail will be overlaid with a tick to show that it has been selected.

1. List View:

    * Click the thumbnail for the required resource - the thumbnail will be overlaid with a tick to show that it has been selected.

1. Card View:

    * Enter selection mode by [selecting the required resource](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#viewingandselectingyourresources) with:

        * Mobile device: select-and-hold
        * Desktop: the [quick action](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#quick-actions) - tick icon:

   ![screen_shot_2018-03-21at160503](assets/screen_shot_2018-03-21at160503.png)

    * The card will be overlaid with a tick to show that the page has been selected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Once in selection mode the **Select** icon (a tick) will change to the **Deselect** icon (a cross).

### Quick Actions (Card View/Desktop Only) {#quick-actions-card-view-desktop-only}

[Quick actions](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#quick-actions) are available:

1. [Navigate to the page](#finding-your-page) you want to take action on.
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the card that represents your required resource; the quick actions are shown:

### Locking Your Page (then Unlocking) {#locking-your-page-then-unlocking}

[Locking a page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#locking-a-page) prevents other authors from working on it while you are. The Lock (and Unlock) icon/button can be found:
