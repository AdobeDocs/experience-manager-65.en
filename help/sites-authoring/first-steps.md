# First Steps for Authors{#first-steps-for-authors}

This section gives you an overview of the main tasks that you will be using when [starting to author content](/help/sites-authoring/author.md#concept-of-authoring-and-publishing) with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

It covers:

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)  
  Detailing the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.  

* [Further Actions](#further-actions)  
  Following on with the many other actions you can use when authoring.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

These detail the basic sequence of events you need for creating and publishing your first page.

### Navigating to the Page Location {#navigating-to-the-page-location}

The content in your website is held in a tree-structure. To create or edit a page you need to [navigate to the location](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources).

### Creating a New Page {#creating-a-new-page}

Before editing, you need to [create a new page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#creating-a-new-page).

### Opening a Page {#opening-a-page}

For many actions, such as editing, you need to [open a page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#opening-a-page-for-editing).

### Editing a Page {#editing-a-page}

Whether your instance already has existing pages or you have just created a new page yourself you can [edit a page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md) by:

* [Inserting a Component (Paragraph)](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#inserting-a-component)
* [Edit/Configure/Copy/Cut/Delete/Paste](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#edit-configure-copy-cut-delete-paste) a Component
* [Edit (Content)](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#edit-content)
* [Edit (Content) - Full Screen Mode](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#edit-content-full-screen-mode)  

* [Undoing and Redoing Page Edits](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#undoing-and-redoing-page-edits)
* [Using Preview Mode](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#preview-mode) (to see how it will look when published)
* [Locking a Page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#locking-a-page)

### Publishing a Page {#publishing-a-page}

Once you have finished editing your page you will want to [publish (or activate) your page](/help/sites-authoring/publishing-pages.md#main-pars-title-10) so that it is available to visitors to your website.

## Further Actions {#further-actions}

After the basic steps there are many other actions you can use when authoring.

### Copying a Page {#copying-a-page}

It is sometimes easier to [copy a page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#copying-and-pasting-a-page) and re-use the content rather than creating everything from scratch again.

### Moving or Renaming a Page {#moving-or-renaming-a-page}

[Moving and renaming pages](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#moving-or-renaming-a-page) is basically done with the same action.

### Unpublishing a Page {#unpublishing-a-page}

To make previously published (or activated) content unavailable on your public website, you [unpublish (or deactivate) the page](/help/sites-authoring/publishing-pages.md#main-pars-title-5).

### Deleting a Page {#deleting-a-page}

If a page is no longer needed you might want to [delete the page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#deleting-a-page).

### Setting the Page Properties {#setting-the-page-properties}

Every [page has properties](/help/sites-authoring/editing-page-properties.md) that you can define to determine aspects of its operation. These can be updated with either UI.

### Creating a Version of a Page {#creating-a-version-of-a-page}

You can [create a version](/help/sites-authoring/working-with-page-versions.md#creating-a-new-version) of a page and then [revert to a version](/help/sites-authoring/working-with-page-versions.md#reverting-to-a-page-version) if necessary.

## More Information {#more-information}

Access to more information about authoring can be found under [Page Authoring](/help/sites-authoring/page-authoring.md).
