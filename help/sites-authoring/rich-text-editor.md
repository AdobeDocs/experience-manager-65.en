# Using the Rich Text Editor to author content {#using-the-rich-text-editor-to-author-content}

The Rich Text Editor (RTE) is a basic building block for authoring text in AEM pages. Many components such as Text, Text and Image, and Table are based on RTE.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Copying nested lists into the RTE does not work as expected. When copying nested lists from Microsoft Word, you will need to manually clean up the lists after pasting the text in the RTE.

## In-place editing {#in-place-editing}

Selecting a text-based component with a single tap or click reveals the [component toolbar](../sites-authoring/editing-content.md#edit-configure-copy-cut-delete-paste).

Tapping/clicking again or initially selecting the component with a slow double-tap/click opens in-place editing, which has its own toolbar. Here you can edit the content and make basic formatting changes.

This toolbar provides the following options:

* **Format**: Set Bold, Italic and Underline formatting.

* **Lists**: Create bulleted or numbered lists or set the indentation.

* **Hyperlink**

* **Unlink**

* **Fullscreen**

* **Close**

* **Save**

## Fullscreen editing {#full-screen-editing}

For text-based components, selecting the full screen mode from the toolbar will open the rich text editor and hide the rest of the page content.

Fullscreen mode shows all the options of your rich text editor, that are configured by your administrator. These can vary across AEM instances [depending on the configuration](../sites-administering/rich-text-editor.md) provided by the administrators or AEM developers. If you find an option missing, ask your administrator to make it available.

Additional rich text editor options include:

* **Anchor**: Create an anchor in the text that you can later link to/reference.
* **Align Text Left**
* **Center Text**
* **Align Text Right**

To close the fullscreen mode, click the minimize icon.
