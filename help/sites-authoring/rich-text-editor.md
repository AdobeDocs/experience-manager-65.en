# Using the Rich Text Editor to Author Content {#use-rich-text-editor-to-author-content}

The Rich Text Editor (RTE) is a basic building block for inserting textual content into AEM. It forms the basis of various components, including:

* [Text](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/wcm-components/text)
* [Table](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/wcm-components/text#table)

## In-Place Editing {#in-place-editing}

Selecting a text-based component with a single click will reveal the [component toolbar](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#edit-configure-copy-cut-delete-paste) as with any component.

Tapping/clicking agin or initially selecting the component with a slow double-click opens in-place editing, which has its own toolbar. Here you can edit the content and make basic formatting changes.
