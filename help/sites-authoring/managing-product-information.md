# Creative Project and PIM Integration{#creative-project-and-pim-integration}

If you are a marketer or creative professional, you can use Creative Project tools in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to manage eCommerce-related product photography and associated creative processes within your organization.

In particular, you can use Creative Project to streamline the following tasks in your photo shoot workflow:

* Generating a photo shoot request
* Uploading a photo shoot
* Collaborating on a photo shoot
* Packaging approved assets

>[!NOTE]

>See [Project User Roles for information](/help/sites-authoring/projects.md#user-roles-in-a-project) on assigning user roles and workflows to certain types of users.

## Exploring Product Photo Shoot workflows  {#exploring-product-photo-shoot-workflows}

Creative Project provides various project templates to meet diverse project requirements. The **Product Photo Shoot Project** template is available out of the box. This template includes photo shoot workflows that let you initiate and manage product photo shoot requests. It also includes a series of tasks that enable you to obtain digital images for products through appropriate review and approval processes.

The template includes the following workflows:

* **Product Photo Shoot (commerce integration) workflow**: This workflow leverages commerce integration with the product information management (PIM) system to automatically generate a shot list for the selected products (hierarchy). You can view the product data as part of the asset metadata after the workflow is complete.
* **Product Photo Shoot workflow**: This workflow lets you provide a shot list instead of depending on commerce integration. It maps the uploaded images to a CSV file in the project assets folder.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The CSV file that is uploaded in the Upload Shot list task of the Product Photo Shoot workflow should have the filename shotlist.csv.

## Create a Product Photo Shoot project {#create-a-product-photo-shoot-project}

1. In the **Projects** console, tap/click **Create** and then choose **Create Project** from the list.

   ![chlimage_1-132](assets/chlimage_1-132a.png)

1. In the **Create Project** page, select the photoshoot project template and tap/click **Next**.

   ![chlimage_1-133](assets/chlimage_1-133a.png)

1. Enter project details, including title, description, and due date. Add users and assign various roles to them. You can also add a thumbnail for the project.

   ![chlimage_1-134](assets/chlimage_1-134a.png)

1. Tap/click **Create**. A confirmation message notifies that the project is created.
1. Tap/click **Done** to return to the **Projects** console. Alternatively, tap/click **Open** to view the assets within the photoshoot project.

## Starting Work in a Product Photo Shoot Project {#starting-work-in-a-product-photo-shoot-project}

To initiate a photo shoot request, tap or click a project and then tap/click **Add Work** within the project details page to start a workflow.

![chlimage_1-135](assets/chlimage_1-135a.png)

A Product Photo Shoot project includes the following out-of-the-box workflows:

* Product Photo Shoot (Commerce Integration) Workflow
* Product Photo Shoot Workflow

Use the Product Photo Shoot (Commerce Integration) workflow to map image assets with the products in AEM. This workflow leverages Commerce Integration to link the approved images to the existing product data at the location */etc/commerce*.

The Product Photo Shoot (Commerce Integration) workflow includes the following tasks:

* Create Shot list
* Upload Photo Shoot
* Retouch Photo Shoot
* Review and Approve
* Move to Production Task

If product information isnâ€™t available in AEM, use the Product Photo Shoot workflow to map image assets with the products based on the details you upload in a CSV file. The CSV file must contain basic product information, such as product ID, category, and description. The workflow fetches approved assets for the products.

This workflow includes the following tasks:

* Upload Shot list
* Upload Photo Shoot
* Retouch Photo Shoot
* Review and Approve
* Move to Production Task

You can customize this workflow using the workflow configurations option.

Both workflows include steps to link products with their approved assets. Each workflow includes the following steps:

* Workflow Configuration: Describes the options to customize the workflow
* Starting a project workflow: Explains how to start a Product Photo Shoot
* Workflow Tasks Details: Provides details of tasks available in the workflow

## Tracking Project Progress {#tracking-project-progress}

You can track the progress of a project by monitoring the active/completed tasks within a project.

Use the following to monitor the progress of a project:

* **Task card**

* **Task list**

The Task card depicts the overall progress of the project. It appears on the Project Details page only if the project has any related tasks. The Task card displays the current completion status of the project based on the number of tasks completed. It does not include future tasks.

The Task card provides the following details:

* Percentage of active tasks
* Percentage of completed tasks

![chlimage_1-136](assets/chlimage_1-136a.png)

The Task list provides detailed information around the currently active workflow task for the project. To display the list, tap/click the Task card. The Task list also displays metadata such as start date, due date, assignee, priority, and status of the task.

![chlimage_1-137](assets/chlimage_1-137a.png)

## Workflow Configuration {#workflow-configuration}
