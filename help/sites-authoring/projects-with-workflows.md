>&ast; These workflows are not started from the **Workflow** tile in Projects. See [Creating Language Copies for Assets.](/help/sites-administering/tc-manage.md)

The steps for starting and completing workflows are the same no matter which workflow you choose. Only the steps change.

You start a workflow directly in Projects (except for DAM Create Language Copy or DAM Create and Translate Language Copy). Information on any outstanding tasks in a project are listed in the **Tasks** tile. Notifications for tasks that need to be completed appear next to the user icon.

For more information on working with workflows in AEM, see the folllowing:

* [Participating in workflows](/help/sites-authoring/workflows-participating.md)
* [Applying workflows to pages](/help/sites-authoring/workflows-applying.md)
* [Configuring workflows](/help/sites-administering/workflows.md)
