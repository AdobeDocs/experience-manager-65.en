# Reports Console {#reports-console}

## Overview {#overview}

For AEM Communities, there are various reports that may be accessed in several ways from the author environment.

In general, the various reports are:

* [Assignments Report](#assignments-report) 

  For an [enablement community](/help/communities/overview.md#enablement-community), provides an overview of learners' progress on their assignments, including an associated score if implementing the SCORM standard.

* [Views Report](#views-report) 

  Provides a chart of views of content by community members and site visitors for any community site.

* [Posts Report](#posts-report) 

  Provides a chart of various types of posts by community members to any community site.

When [Adobe Analytics is enabled](/help/communities/sites-console.md#analytics), reports will include the number of views, plays, comments and ratings for each enablement resource over time.

Tabular reports can be exported in .csv format for subsequent processing.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### No community sites listed {#no-community-sites-listed}

If no community sites are listed, ensure Adobe Analytics has been enabled for a site. If choosing reports on assignments, ensure the assignments function is in the community site's structure.

### Reports do not show in AEM Author instance {#reports-do-not-show-in-aem-author-instance}

If reports do not show up in AEM Author instance check for the customizations, such as URL mapping on Publish instance. If URL mapping is done only on AEM Publish instance of the communities site, ensure that the same has been configured in AEM Author instance in **Site Trend Report Social Component Factory** configuration.
