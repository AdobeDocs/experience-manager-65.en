# Tutorials {#tutorials}

These are examples to help in learning and working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.1 Communities [social component framework (SCF)](scf.md).

## Client-Side Customization {#client-side-customization}

* [SCF client-side customization](client-customize.md)

* [Community Components guide](components-guide.md)

* [Overlay Comments Component](overlay-comments.md)

* [Extend Comments Component](extend-comments.md)

## Server-Side Customization {#server-side-customization}

See also [SCF server-side customization](server-customize.md).

Sample code is available in the [Adobe Experience Cloud GitHub](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud) repository:

* [Customize SCF Component Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-scf-sample-components-customize)

* [Overlay SCF Component Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-scf-sample-components-overlay)

* [Create a Sample Page](create-sample-page.md)

## Demo Users {#demo-users}

The Geometrixx samples package includes demo users. There is often a difference in experience between being a visitor (not logged in) or a member (logged in). And, as long as the Geometrixx samples packages remain installed, you may use these users to simulate a logged in state when exploring with the [Community Components guide](components-guide.md).

For a full list of the demo users, navigate using the Rail to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Operations]** > **[!UICONTROL Security > Users]**. Or use the Classic UI [security console](http://localhost:4502/useradmin) for managing users and groups.

If a [community site has been created](getting-started.md), it is possible to assign demo users to its [community user groups](users.md).
