# Using Liking {#using-liking}

The `Liking` component is a useful tool that allows users to express an opinion about a particular piece of content, such as an comment within a forum. With the `Liking` component, members select the heart icon to indicate a positive opinion.

## Adding Liking to a Page {#adding-liking-to-a-page}

To add a `Liking` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate

* `Communities / Liking`

and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to like.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](essentials-liking.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Liking` component will appear.
