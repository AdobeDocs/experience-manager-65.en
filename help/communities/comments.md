# Using Comments {#using-comments}

## Introduction {#introduction}

The comments feature is used to allow signed-in site visitors (members) to share their opinions and knowledge regarding content on the site. This feature is often already present in other features, but may be added to any website.

The document describes:

* Adding `Comments` to a page.
* Configuration settings for the `Comments` component.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Anonymous posting of a comment is not supported. Site visitors must register (become a member) and sign in to participate.

### Adding Comments to a Page {#adding-comments-to-a-page}

To add a `Comments` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate

* `Communities / Comments`

and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to comment on, or simply at the bottom of the page.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](/help/communities/basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](/help/communities/essentials-comments.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Comments` component appears.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only one `Comments` component may exist on a page. Be aware that several Communities features already include comments, such as a blog, calendar, forum, QnA, and reviews.

### Configuring Comments {#configuring-comments}

Select the placed `Comments` component to access and select the `Configure` icon which opens the edit dialog.

### Changing to a Custom Comment Type {#changing-to-a-custom-comment-type}

By changing the Comment Resource Type, the comment system no longer generates an instance of a comment using the default, but rather one that has been customized (extended) by developers.

Once the custom resource types are known, enter [Design Mode](/help/sites-authoring/default-components-designmode.md) and double click the placed `Comments` component to open a dialog with an extra tab.

Under the **Resource Types** tab, specify the custom resourceType for new instances of the `Comments or Voting` components:

![resource-type](assets/resource-type.png)

* **Comment Resource Type**

  Navigate to the resourceType of an extended `comment` component (single comment) in /apps. For example, `/apps/social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment`

  This resource identifies the resourceType of the UGC created when a visitor posts a comment.

* **Voting Resource Type**

  Navigate to the resourceType of an extended `voting` component in /apps. For example, `/apps/social/components/hbs/voting`

  This resource identifies the resource type of the UGC created when a visitor posts a vote.

* **Comment System Resource Type**

  Navigate to the resourceType of an extended `comments`component (Comment System) in /apps. Leave blank unless the page template [dynamically includes](/help/communities/scf.md#add-or-include-a-communities-component) the Comment System in the underlying script instead of being added to the page as a resource (comments node). Learn more by reading about the [{{include}} helper](/help/communities/handlebars-helpers.md#include).

### Site Visitor Experience {#site-visitor-experience}

#### Moderators and Administrators {#moderators-and-administrators}

When the signed in user has moderator or administrator privileges, they are able to perform the moderation tasks permitted by the configuration of the component, regardless of who authored the comment.

#### Members {#members}

When the site visitor is signed in, depending on the configuration, they may

* Post a new comment
* Edit their own comment
* Delete their own comment
* Flag others' comments

#### Anonymous {#anonymous}

Site visitors who are not signed in may only read posted comments, translate them if supported, but may not add a comment nor flag others' comments.
