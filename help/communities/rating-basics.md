# Rating Essentials {#rating-essentials}

The rating component, a [tally](tally.md) subclass, allows signed in community members to rate a feature on the website.

Placing multiple instances of a voting component on the same page is allowed; each instance must be configured with an unique `tally name` property.

Anonymous posting of a rating is not supported. Site visitors must register and sign in to participate in a rating only once. The signed in visitor (member) may change their rating at any time.

### Accessing Posted Ratings (UGC) {#accessing-posted-ratings-ugc}

UGC should be moderated using one of the standard methods for moderation.
See [Moderating User Generated Content](moderate-ugc.md).

As of AEM 6.1 Communities, use of a [common store](working-with-srp.md) for UGC includes programmatic access to UGC regardless of the chosen storage option (such as ASRP, MSRP or JSRP).

**The location and format of the UGC in the repository is subject to change without warning**.

See:

* [Storage Resource Provider Overview](srp.md) - introduction and repository usage overview.
* [SRP and UGC Essentials](srp-and-ugc.md) - SRP utility methods and examples.
* [Accessing UGC with SRP](accessing-ugc-with-srp.md) - coding guidelines.
* [SocialUtils Refactoring](socialutils.md) - mapping deprecated utility methods to current SRP utility methods.
