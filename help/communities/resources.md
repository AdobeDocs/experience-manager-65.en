# Enablement Resources Console {#enablement-resources-console}

For AEM Communities, the Resources console is where [Enablement Managers](users.md) create, manage and assign resources to members of an enablement community site.

## Requirements {#requirements}

Before adding enablement resources for a community site, the AEM instances must be properly configured, including:

* SCORM
* FFmpeg

For details, see [Configuring Enablement](enablement.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If SCORM is installed after community site creation, any enablement resources present before SCORM is installed must be recreated.

>[!NOTE]
>
>With the release of [AEM 6.3](deploy-communities.md#latestfeaturepack) and the equivalent Communities feature packs [AEM 6.2 FP3](deploy-communities.md#latestfeaturepack) and [AEM 6.1 FP7](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-1/deploy/communities.html#Latest Feature Pack), the enablement feature no longer requires a [MySQL database](mysql.md).

## Terminology {#terminology}

### Resource {#resource}

Resources are essential to an [enablement community](overview.md#enablement-community). They are the materials assigned to members that enable them to improve their skills.

Characteristics of a Resource:

* May be of type:
  * Image (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP)
  * Video (MP4)
  * Flash (SWF)
  * Document (PDF)
  * Quiz (SCORM)
* May be referenced from one or more learning paths.

### Learning Path {#learning-path}

A learning path is a logical set of enablement resources grouped together for ease of assigning to members.

### Members Group {#members-group}

When a community site is created, the name given to the site for the URL is used in the creation of the [site specific user groups](users.md) configured with various permissions for various roles. All of these automatically created groups are prefixed with `Community <site-name>`.

One such user group is `Community <site-name> Members` group, which identifies registered users in the publish environment as community members. See the tutorial [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](getting-started-enablement.md) for an example.

For [engagement communities](overview.md#egagementcommunity), it is reasonable to allow site visitors to self-register or use social login, at which point they are automatically added to the members group.

For [enablement communities](overview.md#enablement-community), it is recommended to make the site private which then requires an administrator to add users to the members group.

## Accessing a Community Site's Enablement Resources {#accessing-a-community-site-s-enablement-resources}

### Navigate to Communities Resources {#navigate-to-communities-resources}

In the author environment, to reach the Resources console

* From global navigation: **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** > **[!UICONTROL Communities]** > **[!UICONTROL Resources]**

  ![enablement-sites](assets/enablement-sites.png)

### Select a Community Site {#select-a-community-site}

The Communities Resources console will display all community sites.

Enablement resources are created for a specific community site after selecting the site from the Resources console.

Once a specific community site is selected, any existing enablement resources and learning paths are accessible for managing and modifying, and new enablement resources and learning paths may be created.

![community-resources](assets/community-resources.png)

#### Search {#search-features}

![searchsite](assets/searchsite.png)

Select the side-panel toggle icon in order to search for an enablement resource or learning path. When selected, a search panel opens up on the left side of the console and provides a text box into which search terms may be entered.

![search-result](assets/search-result.png)

#### Selection Mode {#selection-mode}

To select multiple enablement resources, select the first by hovering over the card and selecting the checkmark icon. Once selected, selecting any other card will add it to the selection group. Selecting a second time de-selects the card.

![selection-mode](assets/selection-mode.png)

## Create a Resource {#create-a-resource}

![create-resource](assets/create-resource1.png)

To add a new enablement resource to the community site

* Select the `Create` icon.
* From the sub-menu which displays, select **[!UICONTROL Resource]**.

This launches a step-by-step process of:

* Describing the resource (name, card image and text).
* Selecting the resource content.
* Selecting a cover image for the resource.
* Identifying resource contacts.
* Assigning resources to members.

When the resource is part of a course, a learning path, members should only be assigned to the learning path. Assignments may be added after the enablement resource has been created.

## Managing a Resource {#managing-a-resource}

To manage a single enablement resource:

* From the **[!UICONTROL Resources]** console, select the community site which contains the resource.
* Select the resource.

For the selected enablement resource, it is possible to:

* View properties (default)
* Edit properties
* Delete

### Report {#report}

![resource-reports](assets/resource-reports.png)

The Report icon provides access to the reports generated when learners interact with their assigned enablement resources in the publish environment. The report varies depending on the type of resource.

For all learning paths, it is possible to view a report based either on resources or learners ( `User Report`.)

![learningpath-info](assets/learningpath-info1.png)

This Report is specifically for the current enablement resource or learning path. The depth of reporting provided depends on whether or not [Adobe Analytics](analytics.md) is licensed and enabled for the community site. The [Timeline](#timeline), [Viewer Engagement](#viewer-engagement), and [Engagement by Device](#engagement-by-device) reports are imported from Adobe Analytics based on the [polling interval](analytics.md#report-importer).

For all enablement resources, regardless of whether or not Adobe Analytics is enabled, there are reports on [Assignee Status](#assignee-status) and [Ratings](#ratings) as well as a [Report Summary](#report-summary) table.

![resource-report](assets/resource-report1.png)

#### Timeline {#timeline}

The Analytics Timeline report shows when events occur over time for this enablement resource:

* **Views**

  A view is when a learner visits the resource details page.

  A comment is when alLearner adds a comment.

The vertical axis is the number of events.

The horizontal axis is calendar time.

[Adobe Analytics required](sites-console.md#analytics).

#### Viewer Engagement {#viewer-engagement}

The Analytics Viewer Engagement report shows, for video resources, the number of learners who have viewed the resource and, if not played to the end, at what point learners stopped playing it.

The vertical axis is the number of learners who have viewed this resource.

The horizontal axis is the duration of this resource.

[Marketing Cloud Org ID required](sites-console.md#enablement).

#### Engagement by Device {#engagement-by-device}

The Analytics Engagement by Device report, for video resources, describes the percentage of views that were played from desktop and from mobile.

[Marketing Cloud Org ID required](sites-console.md#enablement).

#### Assignee Status {#assignee-status}

The Assignee Status report, based on the number of learners, describes how many have

* **Not started**
* **In progress**
* **Completed**

#### Ratings {#ratings}

The Ratings report is based on the number of learners who have rated the enablement resource, showing the number of each star rating followed by a summary of the total number of ratings and the average rating.

#### Report Summary {#report-summary}

For an enablement resource, the Report Summary is a table listing.

* Each learner who has interacted with the resource
  * Their status
  * Whether they were assigned the resource
    * As opposed to their finding the resource in a catalog
    * Number of comments posted
    * The rating given, if any

For a learning path Resource Report, the Report Summary is a table listing

* Each resource included in the learning path
  * Publish status
  * Number of views
  * Number of plays
  * Average rating
  * Format
  * Size
  * Community site name

For a learning path User Report, the Report Summary is a table listing.

* Each learner who is assigned to the learning path:
  * Number of Resources completed.
  * Their status.

It is possible to adjust the display of the table by selecting columns using the `Show / hide columns` selector.

#### Download Report as CSV {#download-report-as-csv}

The Reports Summary table may be downloaded in CSV format using a button at the top of the console.

* For an enablement resource: `Download Resource Report as CSV` button.
* For a learning path: `Download Learning Path Report as CSV` button.

The complete Reports Summary is downloaded regardless of columns chosen for display.
