# Activity Stream Essentials {#activity-stream-essentials}

The activities of a signed in community member, such as posting to a forum or blog, is collected into a stream which may be filtered and displayed in various ways through configuration of the activity streams component.

The ability to follow adds another set of activities when community members follow postings of interest or other community members.

All [community sites](/help/communities/overview.md#communitiessites) include a user profile page for the signed in member that will display member activities in the same manner.

## Concepts {#concepts}

An *activity stream* is the list of recent activities performed by a member or a list of recent activities on a single thread of content, such as a forum topic or blog.

A member my follow an activity stream, by either following another individual or content.

A *news feed* is a merging of the activity streams being followed by a member into a single stream.

A *[social graph](/help/communities/essentials-socialgraph.md)* captures the following relationships of one member to another.
