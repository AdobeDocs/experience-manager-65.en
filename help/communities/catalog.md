# Catalog Feature {#catalog-feature}

The [`Enablement Assignments`](assignments.md) and `Enablement Catalog` components found in the Communities group in the components browser are components of an [enablement community](overview.md#enablement-community).

The `Enablement Catalog` component allows community members to access a catalog of [enablement resources](resources.md). The use of AEM tags is an important part of managing the listing of enablement resources in a catalog (see [Tagging Enablement Resources](tag-resources.md)).

From the [Getting Started with AEM Communities for Enablement](getting-started-enablement.md) tutorial, see a member's view of assignments and catalogs in the [Experience the Published Site](enablement-published-site.md) section.

## Additional Information {#additional-information}

More information may be found on the [Catalog Essentials](catalog-developer-essentials.md) page for developers.

The [catalog function](functions.md#catalog-function) is available when creating a [community site](sites-console.md).
