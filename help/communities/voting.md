# Using Voting {#using-voting}

The `Voting` component is a useful tool that allows community members to rate a particular piece of content, such as an answer within a QnA component. With the `Voting` component, members select up or down arrows to indicate their opinion.

## Adding Voting to a Page {#adding-voting-to-a-page}

To add a `Voting` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate `Communities / Voting` and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to vote on.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](essentials-voting.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Voting` component will appear.
