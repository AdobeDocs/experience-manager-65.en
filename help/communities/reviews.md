# Using Reviews and Reviews Summary (Display) {#using-reviews-and-reviews-summary-display}

The `Reviews` component is a composite of [Comments](comments.md) and [Rating](rating.md) components ready for use.

The `Reviews Summary (Display)` component provides a summary of an active or closed instance of a `Reviews` component for display elsewhere on the site.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Anonymous posting of a review is not supported. Site visitors must register (become a member) and sign in to participate. The signed in visitor may update their review at any time.

## Adding a Review to a Page {#adding-a-review-to-a-page}

To add a `Reviews` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate `Communities / Reviews` and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for users to review.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](reviews-basics.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Reviews` component will appear.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Allowed Ratings]** tab, specify the complete list of ratings to be shown to members. The first rating should be an overall/general rating, as it is the rating which provides the average rating for the `Review Summary (Display)` component. The next two ratings in the default configuration should be given a different title, other than "Subrating 1" or "Subrating 2".

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](reviews-basics.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Reviews Summary (Display)`component will appear.

* `Review Path`

  enter or browse to the placed instance of the `reviews`component to summarize, for example, if added to the Web Page of the [Geometrixx Engage site,](getting-started.md) the path would be:

### Changing to a Custom Review Type {#changing-to-a-custom-review-type}

By changing the Comment Resource Type, the comment system will no longer generate an instance of a comment using the default, but rather one that has been customized (extended) by developers.

Once the custom resource types is known, enter [Design Mode](../../help/sites-authoring/default-components-designmode.md) and double click on the placed `Comments` component to open a dialog with an additional tab.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Resource Types]** tab, specify the custom resourceType for new instances of the `Comments or Voting` components:

  Navigate to the resourceType of an extended `comment`component (single comment) in /apps. For example, `/apps/social/commons/components/hbs/comments/comment`.
