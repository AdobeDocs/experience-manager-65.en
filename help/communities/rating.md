# Using Ratings {#using-ratings}

The `Rating` component is used standalone or in conjunction with other Communities features. This component allows signed-in community members to express their opinions by rating content.

## Adding a Rating to a Page {#adding-a-rating-to-a-page}

To add a `Rating` component to a page in author mode, locate the component `Communities / Rating` and drag it into place on a page, such as a position relative to the feature for members to rate.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](rating-basics.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Rating` component will appear.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Texts & Labels]** tab you specify the internal identifier for the Rating.
