# Leaderboard Feature {#leaderboard-feature}

## Introduction {#introduction}

The `Leaderboard` component provides the ability to obtain a sense of how members are interacting within the community by ranking members according to points earned (basic scoring) or their expertise (advanced scoring).

Prior to including the leaderboard component on a page, it is necessary to configure [Communities Scoring and Badges](/help/communities/implementing-scoring.md).

This section of the documentation describes:

* Adding the `Leaderboard` component to a [community site](/help/communities/overview.md#community-sites).
* Configuration settings for the `Leaderboard` component.

### Adding a Leaderboard to a Page {#adding-a-leaderboard-to-a-page}

To add a `Leaderboard` component to a page in author mode, locate the component

* `Communities / Leaderboard`

and drag it into place on a page.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](/help/communities/basics.md).

When first placed on a page of a community site, this is how the component appears:
