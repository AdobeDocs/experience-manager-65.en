# Configuring Email {#configuring-email}

AEM Communities uses email for:

* [Communities Notifications](notifications.md)
* [Communities Subscriptions](subscriptions.md)

By default, the email feature is not functional as it requires specification of an SMTP server and SMTP user.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Email for notifications and subscriptions must be configured only on the [primary publisher](deploy-communities.md#primary-publisher).

## Default Mail Service Configuration {#default-mail-service-configuration}

The default mail service is required for both notifications and subscriptions.

* Log in to the primary publisher with administrator privilege and access the [Web Console](../../help/sites-deploying/configuring-osgi.md):

  * For example, [http://localhost:4503/system/console/configMgr](http://localhost:4503/system/console/configMgr)

* Locate the `Day CQ Mail Service`.
* Select the edit icon.

This is based on the documentation for [Configuring Email Notification](../../help/sites-administering/notification.md), but with a difference in that the field `"From" address` is *not* required and should be left empty.

For example (filled in with values for illustrative purposes only):

![email-config](assets/email-config.png)

* **[!UICONTROL SMTP server host name]** 

  *(Required)* The SMTP server to use.

* **[!UICONTROL SMTP server port]** 

  *(Required)* The SMTP server port must be 25 or higher.

* **[!UICONTROL SMTP user]**

  *(Required)* The SMTP user.

* **[!UICONTROL SMTP password]**

  *(Required)* The SMTP user's password.

* **[!UICONTROL "From" address]** 

  Leave empty
* **[!UICONTROL SMTP use SSL]** 

  If checked, will send secure email. Ensure the port is set to 465 or as required for SMTP server.
* **[!UICONTROL Debug email]** 

  If checked, enables logging of SMTP server interactions.

## AEM Communities Email Configuration {#aem-communities-email-configuration}

Once the [default mail service](#default-mail-service-configuration) is configured, the two existing instances of the `AEM Communities Email Reply Configuration` OSGi config, included in the release, become functional.

Only the instance for subscriptions needs to be further configured when allowing reply by email.

1. [Email](#configuration-for-notifications) instance:

   For notifications, which does not support reply email, and should not be altered.

1. [Subscriptions-email](#configuration-for-subscriptions) instance:

   Requires configuration to fully enable creating post from reply email.

To reach the Communities email configuration instances:

* Log in to the primary publisher with administrator privilege and access the [Web Console](../../help/sites-deploying/configuring-osgi.md)

  * For example, [http://localhost:4503/system/console/configMgr](http://localhost:4503/system/console/configMgr)

* Locate `AEM Communities Email Reply Configuration`.

![email-reply-config](assets/email-reply-config.png)

### Configuration for Notifications {#configuration-for-notifications}

The instance of `AEM Communities Email Reply Configuration` OSGi config with the Name email is forthenotifications feature. This feature does not include email reply.

  The email is built using template stored at this root path. Default is `/etc/community/templates/subscriptions-email`.

## Configure Polling Importer {#configure-polling-importer}

In order for the email to be brought into the repository, it is necessary to configure a polling importer and configure its properties in the repository manually.

### Add New Polling Importer {#add-new-polling-importer}

* Log in to the primary publisher with administrator privilege and browse to the polling importer console:
  
  For example, [http://localhost:4503/etc/importers/polling.html](http://localhost:4503/etc/importers/polling.html)

* Select **[!UICONTROL Add]**

  ![polling-importer](assets/polling-importer.png)

* **[!UICONTROL Type]**

  *(Required)* Pull down to select `POP3 (over SSL)`.

* **[!UICONTROL URL]**

  *(Required)* The outbound mail server. For example, `pop.gmail.com:995/INBOX?username=community-emailgmail.com&password=****`.

  *(Required)* Set to `/content/usergenerated/mailFolder/postEmails`
  by browsing to the `postEmails`folder and select **OK**.

* **[!UICONTROL Update Interval in Seconds]**

  *(Optional)* The mail server configured for the default mail service may have requirements regarding the update interval value. For example, Gmail may require an interval of `300`.

* Select **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

### Adjust Protocol for New Polling Importer {#adjust-protocol-for-new-polling-importer}

Once the new polling configuration is saved, it is necessary to further modify properties of the subscription email importer in order to change the protocol from `POP3` to `emailreply`.

Using [CRXDE Lite](../../help/sites-developing/developing-with-crxde-lite.md):

* Log in to the primary publisher with administrator privilege and browse to [https://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/crx/de/index.jsp#/etc/importers/polling](http://localhost:4503/crx/de/index.jsp#/etc/importers/polling).
* Select the newly created configuration and modify the following properties:

  * **feedType**: Replace `pop3s` with **`emailreply`**
  * **source**: Replace source's protocol `pop3s://` with **`emailreply://`**

The red triangles indicate the modified properties. Be sure to save the changes:
