# Components for Page Authoring{#components-for-page-authoring}

The following components are intended for use when authoring content for a standard web page. They form a subset of the components available out-of-the-box for a standard installation of AEM.

Some are immediately available through the sidekick, various others are also available by using [Design mode](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-design-mode.md) to enable/disable them.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This section only discusses components that are available out-of-the-box in a standard AEM installation.
>
>Depending on your instance you may have customized components developed explicitly for your requirements. These may even have the same name as some of the components discussed here.

The components are available when [editing a page](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-edit-content.md) from the **Components** tab of the sidekick and the **Insert New Component** selector (when you double-click in the **Drag components or assets here** area).

You can select a component and drag it to the required location on your page and then [Edit Content and Properties](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-edit-content.md#editing-a-component-content-and-properties).

Components are sorted according to various categories (component groups) including (for page authoring):

* [General](#general): Includes basic components, including text, images, tables, charts, and so on.
* [Columns](#columns): Includes components necessary for organizing the layout of the content.
* [Form](#formgroup): Includes all the components needed to create a form.

## General {#general}

The General components are the basic components that you use to create content.

### Account Item {#account-item}

You can define a link with title and description.

![](do-not-localize/chlimage_1-2.png)

### Adaptive Image {#adaptive-image}

The Adaptive Image foundation component generates images that are sized to fit the window in which the web page is opened. To use the component, you provide an image resource either from the file system or DAM. When the web page is opened, the web browser downloads a copy of the image that has been resized so that it is suitable for the current window.

The following characteristics can determine the size of the window:

* Device screen: Mobile devices typically display web pages so that they extend across the entire screen.
* Web browser window size: Users of laptop and desktop computers can resize web browser windows.

For example, the component generates a small image when the web page is opened on a cell phone, and a medium-sized image when opened on a tablet. On a laptop, the component creates an delivers a large image when the page is opened in a maximized web browser. When the web browser is resized to fit a portion of the screen, the component adapts by delivering a smaller image and refreshes the view.

#### Supported Image Formats {#supported-image-formats}

You can use image files of the following file name extensions with the Adaptive Image component:

* .jpg
* .jpeg
* .png
* .gif &#42;&#42;

>[!CAUTION]
>
>&#42;&#42; Animated .gif files are not supported in AEM for adaptive renditions.

#### Images Sizes and Quality {#images-sizes-and-quality}

The following table lists the width of the image that is generated for the given viewport width. The height of the generated image is calculated to maintain a constant aspect ratio and no whitespace occurs inside the image edge. Cropping can be used to avoid whitespace.

When the image is a JPEG image, the viewport size can also influence the JPEG quality. The following JPEG qualities are possible:

* Low (0.42)
* Medium (0.82)
* High (1.00)

| Viewport Width Range (pixels) |Image Width (pixels) |JPEG Quality |Targeted Device Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| width <= 319 |320 |low |  |
| width = 320 |320 |medium |Cell phone (portrait) |
| 320 < width < 481 |480 |medium |Cell phone (landscape) |
| 480 < width < 769 |476 |high |Tablet (portrait) |
| 768 < width < 1025 |620 |high |Tablet (landscape) |
| width <= 1025 |full (original size) |high |Desktop |

#### Properties {#properties}

The dialog allows you to edit properties for your instance of the Adaptive Image component, many of which are common with the Image component on which it is based. The properties are available in two tabs:

* **Image**

    * **Image**
      Drag an image from the content finder or click to open a browse window where you can load an image. After the image is loaded, you can crop the image, rotate it, or delete it. To zoom in and out of the image, use the slide bar beneath the image (above the OK and Cancel buttons)

    * **Crop**
      Crop an image. Drag the border to crop the image.

    * **Rotate**
      Click Rotate repeatedly until the image is rotated as desired.

    * **Clear**
      Remove the current image.

* **Advanced**

    * **Title**
      The Adaptive Image component does not use this property.

    * **Alt Text**
      The alternate text to use for the image.

    * **Link To**
      The Adaptive Image component does not use this property.

    * **Description**
      The Adaptive Image component does not use this property.

#### Extending the Adaptive Image Component {#extending-the-adaptive-image-component}

For information about customizing the Adaptive Image component, see [Understanding the Adaptive Image Component](/help/sites-developing/responsive.md#using-adaptive-images).

### Carousel {#carousel}

The Carousel Component allows you to display images associated with individual pages:

* one at a time
* for a short time
* in an order you specify
* with a time delay that you specify

Clickable controls also let the user cycle through the displayed pages in real time, on demand. Clicking on the currently visible page image takes you to that page. In other words, the Carousel acts as a navigation control.

#### Properties {#properties-1}

These are available in two tabs:

* **Carousel**
  Here you specify how the carousel operates:

    * Play Speed
      The time in milliseconds before the next slide is shown.
    * Transition Time
      Time in milliseconds for the transition between two slides.
    * Controls Style
      Various options are available from a pulldown menu; for example, Prev / Next Buttons, Top-Right Switches.

* **List**
  Here you specify how pages are included in your Carousel:

    * **Build list using**
      There are several ways to build a page list - Child Pages, Fixed List, Search, or Advanced Search (all described below).
      Note that no matter which method you choose, the pages you include in your list should each already have an image associated with the page, it is this image that will be displayed in the Carousel. If there is no image for a given page under that page's Page Properties, you should associate an image with the page before beginning, as otherwise the Carousel will display a blank (or mostly blank) page. See [Editing Page Properties](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-edit-page-properties.md).
      Depending on the item you choose a new panel will appear:

        * **Options for Child Pages**

            * **Parent Page**
              Specify a path either manually or using the selector. Leave empty to use the current page as parent.

        * **Options for Fixed List**

            * **Pages**
              Select a list of pages. Use `+` to add more entries and the up/down buttons to adjust the order.

        * **Options for Search**

            * **Start in**
              Enter a starting path, either manually or using the selector.

            * **Search query**
              You can enter a plain text search query.

        * **Options for Advanced Search**

            * **Querybuilder predicate notation**
              You can enter a search query using Querybuilder predicate notation. For example, you can enter "fulltext=Marketing" to have all pages with "Marketing" in their content show up in the Carousel.
              See [QueryBuilder API](/help/sites-developing/querybuilder-api.md) for full discussion of query expressions and further examples.

    * **Order by**
      Select `jcr:title`, `jcr:created`, `cq:lastModified`, or `cq:template` from the dropdown menu.

    * **Limit**
      The maximum number of items you would like to use in the Carousel; this is optional.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create a custom carousel component for Adobe Experience Manager that displays digital assets located in the AEM DAM. For information, see [Creating Custom Carousel components for Adobe Experience Manager](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/custom-carousel-components.html).

### Chart {#chart}

The Chart component lets you add a bar, line, or pie chart. AEM creates a chart from the data you provide. You provide data by typing directly into the Data tab or by copying and pasting a spreadsheet.

* **Data**

    * **Chart Data**
      Enter your chart data using the CSV format; the Comma Separated Values format uses commas (",‚Äù) as the field separator.

* **Advanced**

    * **Chart Type**
      Select from Pie Chart, Line Chart, and Bar Chart.

    * **Alternative text**
      Alternative text that displays instead of the chart.

    * **Width**

    * **Height**
      Height of the chart in pixels.

The following show an example of chart data followed by the resulting Bar chart:

![chlimage_1-6](assets/chlimage_1-6.png) ![dc_chart_use](assets/dc_chart_use.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can create a custom AEM chart control that displays data located in the AEM JCR. For information, see [Displaying Adobe Experience Manager Data in a Chart](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/using/displaying-experience-manager-data-chart.html).

### Content Fragment {#content-fragment}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The full functionality of Content Fragment Management is only available with the touch-optimized UI.
>
>The Content Fragment component can be seen in the classic UI sidekick, but further functions are not available.

[Content fragments](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-content-fragments.md) are created and managed as page-independent assets. You can then use these fragments, and their variations, when authoring your content pages.

### Design Importer {#design-importer}

This allows you to upload a zip file holding a design package.

### Download {#download}

The Download component creates a link on the selected web-page to download a specific file. You can either drag an asset from the Content Finder or upload a file.

### Video {#video}

The **Video** component allows you to place a predefined, out-of-the-box video element on a page.

See also [Configure your Video Profiles](/help/sites-administering/config-video.md#configuringvideoprofiles) for use with HTML5 elements.

After placing an instance of the component on your page you can configure:

* Video

    * **Video asset**

      Upload or drop your video asset.

    * **Size**

      The video's native size (width x height in pixels) will appear in the boxes next to Size (see above). Manually enter width and height dimensions here if you wish to override the video's native dimensions. Click **OK** to dismiss the dialog.

>[!NOTE]

## Columns {#columns}

Columns are a mechanism to control the layout of content in AEM. In a standard installation components for creating two and/or 3 columns are provided.

The following example shows the 2 Columns and 3 Columns components in use. You can use the placeholders for new components:

![chlimage_1-14](assets/chlimage_1-14.png)

### 2 Columns {#columns-1}

A Column Control component that defaults to 2 equal columns.

### 3 Columns {#columns-2}

A Column Control component that defaults to 3 equal columns.

### Column Control {#column-control}

The Column Control component lets users select how they want to split the content in the main panel of the web-page into multiple columns. Users can select the number of columns required (from a predefined list) and then create, delete, or move content within each of the columns.

* **Column Control**

    * **Column Layout**

      Select the number of columns you want rendered. Once created, each column has its own link for dragging components or assets when adding content.

## Form {#form}

Form components are used to create forms for visitors to submit input. Forms and form components can be used to collect information including user feedback (for example, a customer satisfaction questionnaire) and user information (for example, user registration).

>[!NOTE]
>
>See [AEM Forms Help](/help/forms/home.md) for information about AEM Forms.

Forms are built up from several different components:

* **Form**

  The form component defines the beginning and end of a new form on a page. Other components can then be placed in between these elements, such as tables, downloads, and so on.

* **Form fields and elements**

  Form fields and elements can include text boxes, radio buttons, images, and so on. The user often completes an action in a form field, such as typing text. See individual form elements for more information.

* **Profile Components**

  Profile components relate to visitor profiles used for social collaboration and other areas where visitor personalization is required.

The following shows an example form; it is comprised of the **Form** component (start and end), with two **Form** **Text** fields used for input, a **General** **Text** field used for the lead-in text and a **Submit** button.

![dc_form](assets/dc_form.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Information about developing and customizing your forms further is available on the [Developing Forms page](/help/sites-developing/developing-forms.md). This includes adding actions, constraints, preloading fields and using scripts to call a service to take action, amongst others.

### Settings Common to (Many) Form Components {#settings-common-to-many-form-components}

Although each of the form components has a different purpose, many are composed of similar options and parameters.

When configuring any of the form components the following tabs are available in the dialog:

* **Title and Text**

  Here you need to specify the basic information, such as the title of the form and any accompanying text. Where appropriate it also allows you to define other key information such as whether the field is multi-selectable and items available for selection.

* **Initial Values**

  Allows you to specify a default value.

* **Constraints**

  Here you can specify whether a field is required and place constraints are on that field (for example, must be numeric, and so on).

* **Styling**

  Indicates the size and styling of the fields.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The fields you see vary significantly depending on the individual component.

These tabs provide you with the necessary parameters; these can depend on the individual component type, but can include:

* **Title and Text**

    * **Element Name**

      Name of the form element. This indicates where in the repository the data is stored.
      This is a required field and should only contain the following characters:

        * alphanumeric characters
        * `_ . / : -`

    * **Title**

      The title displayed with the field. If left blank, the default title will be shown.

    * **Description**

      Allows you to provide additional information for the user, if necessary. On the form this is shown below the field, in a smaller font than the title.

    * **Show/Hide**

      Determines when the field is visible.

* **Initial Values**

    * **Default Value**

      The value displayed in the field when the form is opened; ie before the user has made any input.

* **Constraints**

    * **Required**

      This is dependent on the form component type, but provides one or more click boxes to indicate that this field, or certain parts of this field, is/are required.

    * **Required Message**

      A message to inform users that this field is required; a required field will also be flagged with and asterisk.

    * **Constraint**

      The constraints available for selection are dependent on the form component type.

    * **Constraint Message**

      A message to inform users what is required.

* **Styling**

    * **Size**

      In rows and columns.

    * **Width**

      In pixels.

    * **CSS**

### Form (component) {#form-component}

The Form component defines both the start and end of a form using the **Form Start** and **Form End** elements. These are always paired to ensure that the form is correctly defined.

![dc_form-1](assets/dc_form-1.png)

In between the start and end of a form, you can add form components that define the actual input fields for users.

#### Start of Form {#start-of-form}

This component is needed to define the start of a new form on a page. You can configure:

* **Form**

    * **Thank You Page**

      The page to be referenced to thank visitors for providing their input. If left blank, the form re-displays after submission.

    * **Start Workflow**

      Determines which workflow is triggered once a form is submitted.

* **Advanced**

    * **Action Type**

      A form needs an action. The action defines the operation that is triggered for execution with the data submitted by the user (similar to action= in HTML). Some need a corresponding **Action Configuration**.

      A selection of action types are included in a standard AEM installation:

        * **Account Request**
        * **Create Content**
        * **Create Lead**
        * **Create and Update Account**
        * **E-Mail Service: Create Subscriber and add to list**
        * **E-Mail Service: Send auto-responder email**
        * **E-Mail Service: Unsubscribe user from list**
        * **Edit Community**
        * **Edit Resource(s)**
        * **Edit Workflow Controlled Resource(s)**

        * **Reset Password**
        * **Set Password**
        * **Store Content**

          This is the default action type.

        * **Store Content with Uploads**
        * **Submit Order**
        * **Unsubscribe Subscriber**
        * **Update Order**

    * **Form Identifier**

      The form identifier uniquely identifies the form. Use the form identifier if you have several forms on a single page; make sure they have different identifiers.

    * **Load Path**

      The path to node properties used to load predefined values into the form fields.
      This is an optional field that specifies the path to a node in the repository. When this node has properties that match the field names, then the appropriate fields on the form are preloaded with the value of those properties. If no match exists, then the field contains the default value.
      Using **Load Path** you can preload the form with values in the required fields. See [Preloading Form Values](/help/sites-developing/developing-forms.md#preloading-form-values).

    * **Client Validation**

      Indicates whether client validation is required for this form (server validation *always* occurs.). This can be achieved in conjunction with the **Forms Captcha** component.

    * **Validation Resource Type**

      Defines the form validation resource type if you want to validate the entire form (instead of individual fields). If you are validating the complete form, also include one of the following:

        * A script for client validation:

          `/apps/<myApp>/form/<myValidation>/formclientvalidation.jsp`

        * A script for validation on the server side:

          `/apps/<myApp>/form/<myValidation>/formservervalidation.jsp`

    * **Action Configuration**

      The options available in **Action Configuration** are dependent on the **Action Type** selected:

        * **Account Request**

          * **Create Account Page**
              The page used when creating a new account.

        * **Create Content**

            * Content Path
              The content path for any content that the form dumps. Enter a path that ends with a slash `/`. The slash means that for each form port, a new node is created at the given location; for example:
              `/forms/feedback/`

            * **Type**

              Select the required type.
