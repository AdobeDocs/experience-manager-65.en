# Authoring Pages{#authoring-pages}

The following provides an overview to authoring with AEM:

* [First Steps for Authors](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-first-steps.md) - an introduction for new authors

>[!NOTE]
>
>This section covers the tasks involved when authoring a content page. <!-- There are many additional features closely related to page authoring, these are covered under [Site and Page Features](/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-feature.md). -->

## Quick Overview of Features Used for Authoring Pages {#quick-overview-of-features-used-for-authoring-pages}

To aid you when authoring pages the author environment provides features such as:

* **Drag and drop**
  Components (such as Text, Image) and digital assets (such as images) can be positioned on the page simply by dragging and dropping them in the desired location.

* **Editing**
  Once positioned on your page, a component-specific dialog can be opened to enter content and/or configure characteristics of that component (for example, image size).

* **In-place Editing**
  Text and Image components can be edited directly on the webpage without opening a dialog box or an explicit save action.

* **[Sidekick](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-env-tools.md#sidekickclassicui)**
  A floating "inspector" window that appears on the editable page. From here new components can be dragged onto the page and page-specific actions can be executed.

* **[Content Finder](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-page-author-env-tools.md#thecontentfinderclassicui)**
  On the left side of each authorable page, the content finder provides quick access to a range of assets, including digital assets (such as other images, Flash elements and documents), other pages and paragraphs. These items can be dragged to the page; for example to position assets or create links to other pages.

* **Context menu**
  Right clicking on most onscreen elements (for example, paragraphs on the page) brings up a context menu with appropriate action options.

* **Search as you type**
  In certain scenarios (for example, path selection in edit dialogs) searching for content through the AEM interface presents dynamic matches as you type the query.
