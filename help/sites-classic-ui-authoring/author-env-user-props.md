    * Show when needed (Default)
    * Always show
    * Keep Hidden

  The functionality of [Impersonate as](/help/sites-administering/security.md#impersonating-another-user) lets a user work on behalf of another user.

* **Language**
  The language to use for the UI of the authoring environment. Select the required language from the available list.

* **Window Management**
  Select either:

    * Multiple Windows (Default)
      Pages are opened in a new window.
    * Single Window
      Pages are opened in the current window.
