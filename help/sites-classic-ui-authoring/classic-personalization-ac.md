# Working with Adobe Campaign{#working-with-adobe-campaign}

Adobe Campaign is a set of solutions that lets you personalize and deliver campaigns across all of your online and offline channels.

This documentation describes how to work with Adobe Campaign:

* Adobe Campaign 6.1, which is the on-premise solution.
* Adobe Campaign Standard, which is the subscription-based solution.

See the following:

* [Adobe Campaign Components](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-personalization-ac-components.md)
* [Targeting your Adobe Campaign](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classic-personalization-ac-target.md)

You must previously have [integrated AEM with Adobe Campaign](/help/sites-administering/campaign.md).
