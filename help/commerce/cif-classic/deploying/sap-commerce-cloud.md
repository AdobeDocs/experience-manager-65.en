>`Geometrixx Outdoors Site English (US)`

Deploying the [necessary eCommerce packages](#packages-needed-for-ecommerce-with-hybris) will provide the full functionality of the eCommerce framework, together with a reference implementation of eCommerce functionality as provided with a hybris implementation (including a demonstration catalog)

This is available under the English (US) branch ( `/content/geometrixx-outdoors/en_US`) of the Geometrixx Outdoors site:

* [Product Information](#productinformationwithcolorvariants) (with color variants when appropriate)

* [Shopping Cart content overviews](#shoppingcartcontentoverview)
* [Customer Sign-Up](#customersignup) and [Customer Sign-In](#customersignin)

* [Access to the hybris management console](#accesstothehybrismanagementconsole)

### Technical Requirements - hybris Server {#technical-requirements-hybris-server}

The hybris extension of the eCommerce Integration Framework has been updated to support Hybris 5 (as default), while maintaining backward compatibility with [Hybris 4](/help/sites-developing/sap-commerce-cloud.md#developing-for-hybris).

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Supports versions 18.11 and above.
>* You will need Java 7 to run the [hybris 5 server.](https://www.hybris.com/en/architecture-technology)
>* The hybris add-on, the [Telco Accelerator](https://www.hybris.com/en/products/telecommunication), is not supported by the AEM extension.
