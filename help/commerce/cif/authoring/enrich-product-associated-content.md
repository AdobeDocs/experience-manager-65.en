# Enrich Product Data with Associated AEM Content

Learn how marketers can enrich product data with associated content from Adobe Experience Manager. Content, like assets, Experience Fragments, and Content Fragments in AEM can be associated with commerce products. Once associated, these content types can be dynamically inserted on to a placeholder within a product page or category page. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for marketers to target specific product page with additional content like images and video.
