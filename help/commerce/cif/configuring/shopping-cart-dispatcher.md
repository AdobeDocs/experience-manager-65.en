# Shopping Cart and Dispatcher Setup

[AEM CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) comes with an out of the box [shopping cart](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components/tree/master/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/core/cif/components/commerce/minicart/v1/minicart) which renders a cart and checkout form. The shopping cart requires an [AEM Dispatcher with GraphQL](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components/blob/master/dispatcher) routing setup. The following video details a local configuration and setup using a Docker image.
