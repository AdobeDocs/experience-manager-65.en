# Content and Commerce {#content-commerce}

With Adobe Experience Manager content and commerce, brands can scale and innovate faster to differentiate commerce experiences and capture accelerating online spend. AEM Content and Commerce combines the immersive, omnichannel, and personalized experiences in Experience Manager with any number of commerce solutions to bring differentiated experiences to all parts of the shopping journey, reducing time to value and driving higher conversion.

## How Content and Commerce Helps Customers Being Successful

With ever-increasing customer expectations for online commerce experiences, brands are pressured to deliver differentiated experiences and more content faster. However, implementing a content management platform often requires heavy time and budget investments in developing foundational elements, such as custom components and authoring tools, and accrues costs in maintenance and upgrades. Experience Manager Sites offers Content and Commerce as an add-on module for Experience Manager as a Cloud Service that provides out-of-the-box commerce core components, authoring tools, and a reference storefront to accelerate go-live, enable seamless collaboration across teams, and drive conversion.

Brands can integrate Experience Manager with Adobe Commerce, part of Adobe Experience Cloud, as well as any commerce engine of choice. With Experience Manager Content and Commerce, brands can:

* Scale and innovate faster
* Personalize experiences to drive conversion
* reate once, and publish everywhere
* Enrich and differentiate experiences for customers
* Streamline authoring with commerce data access

## Introducing AEM Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) {#cif-intro}

As these projects have to deal with the complexity of integrating a commerce solution. A commerce solution can be anything from a commercial solution such as the Adobe Commerce Cloud to a set of custom commerce services. The integration is highly dependent on the use-cases and ecosystem. It usually touches various places and comes in many different flavors:

* Integration of a complex and dynamic ecosystem (example product catalogs)
* Business needs to manage product content with its own lifecycle in an efficient and omnichannel way
* Building complex and personalized shopping journeys for various heads
* Ability to quickly adapt and innovate on the back- and front-end
* Running a scalable and stable E2E infrastructure that is built for peak performance (Flash sale, Black Friday, ...). This includes unified search and cache management.

This complexity opens up the door to potential point of failures, increased TCO, delays, and reduced value realization. These reasons have led to the development of the Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) which is an add-on for the Experience Manager. CIF extends the Experience Manager with commerce capabilities and standardizes the integration with a commerce engine. The result is a future-proof, stable and scalable solution with lower TCO. It unlocks technical and business innovation with agile tooling and seamlessly integrated features to build compelling commerce experiences.
