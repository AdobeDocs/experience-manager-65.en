# Getting started with AEM Content and Commerce {#start}

To get started with AEM Content and Commerce, you need to install the AEM Content and Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5.

## Minimum Software Requirement

[AEM 6.5 Service Pack](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html) 7 or later is required.

## Onboarding {#onboarding}

The onboarding for AEM Content and Commerce is a two-step process:

1. Install the AEM Content and Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5

2. Connect AEM with your commerce solution

### Install the AEM Content and Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5 {#install-add-on}

Download and install the AEM Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5 from the [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html) portal.

Start and install the requiered AEM 6.5 Service Pack. We recommend installing the last available service pack.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This will be done by the CSE for AEM Managed Service customers.

### Connect AEM to your Commerce System {#connect}

AEM can be connected to any commerce system that has an accessible GraphQL endpoint for AEM. These endpoints are usually publicly available, or can be connected via private VPN or local connections depending on the individual project setup.

Optionally, authentication header can be provided to use additional CIF features that require authentication.

Projects generated by the [AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype), and the [AEM Venia Reference Store](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-guides-venia) which is already included in the [default config](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-guides-venia/blob/main/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/venia/osgiconfig/config/com.adobe.cq.commerce.graphql.client.impl.GraphqlClientImpl~default.cfg.json) must be adjusted.

Replace the value of the `url` in `com.adobe.cq.commerce.graphql.client.impl.GraphqlClientImpl~default.cfg.json` with the GraphQL endpoint of your commerce system. This configuration can be done via the OSGI console or by deploying the OSGI configuration via the project. Different configurations for staging and production systems are supported using different AEM run modes.

The AEM Content and Commerce Add-On and CIF Core Components use both AEM server-side and client-side connections. Client-side CIF Core Components and CIF Add-On authoring tools connect by default to `/api/graphql`. This can be adjusted via the CIF Cloud Service config if needed (see below).

The CIF Add-On provides a GraphQL proxy servlet at `/api/graphql` which can optionally be used for [local development](develop.md). For production deployments it is strongly recommended to setup a reverse proxy to the commerce GraphQL endpoint via the AEM Dispatcher or at other network layers (like CDN).

## Configuring Stores and Catalogs {#catalog}

The Add-On and the [CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) can be used on multiple AEM site structures connected to different commerce stores (or store views, and so on). By default, the CIF Add-On is deployed with a default config connecting to Adobe Commerce's default store and catalog.

This configuration can be adjusted for the project via the CIF Cloud Service config following these steps:

1. In AEM go to Tools > Cloud Services > CIF Configuration

2. Select the commerce configuration you want to change

3. Open the configuration properties via the action bar

![CIF Cloud Services Configuration](/help/commerce/cif/assets/cif-cloud-service-config.png)

The following properties can be configured:

- GraphQL Client - select the configured GraphQL client for commerce backend communication. This should typically stay at default.
- Store View - the store view identifier. If empty, the default store view is used.
- GraphQL Proxy Path - the URL path GraphQL Proxy in AEM use to proxy requests to the commerce backend GraphQL endpoint.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In most setups the default value `/api/graphql` must not be changed. Only advanced setup not using the provided GraphQL proxy should change this setting.

- Enable Catalog UID Support - enable support for UID instead of ID in the commerce backend GraphQL calls.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Support for UIDs got introduced in Adobe Commerce 2.4.2. Only enable this if your commerce backend supports a GraphQL schema of version 2.4.2 or later.

- Catalog Root Category Identifier - the identifier (UID or ID) of the store catalog root

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >Starting with CIF Core Components version 2.0.0 the support for `id` was removed and replaced with `uid`. If your project uses CIF Core Components version 2.0.0 you must enable Catalog UID Support and use a valid category UID as "Catalog Root Category Identifier".

The configuration shown above is for reference. Projects should provide their own configurations.

For more complex setups using multiple AEM site structures combined with different commerce catalogs see the [Commerce Multi-Store Setup](configuring/multi-store-setup.md) tutorial.
