# Getting started with AEM Content and Commerce {#start}

To get started with AEM Content and Commerce, you need an install the AEM Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5.

## Required software

To use the AEM Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5 and AEM 6.5 deployment with AEM 6.5 Service Pack 7 or later is required.

## Onboarding {#onboarding}

The onboarding for AEM Content and Commerce is a two-step process:

1. Download and install the AEM Commerce Add-On for AEM 6.5 from the [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html) portal.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >This will be done by the CSE for AEM Managed Service customers.

2. Connect AEM with your commerce solution

    To connect the AEM Commerce Add-On & the [AEM CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) with a commerce solution, you need to provide the GraphQL endpoint URL of your commerce environment via the OSGi configuration.
    That GraphQL endpoint must be accessible by the AEM instances, which typically means it must be publicly available, private VPN or local connections might work as well depending on your individual project setup. Optionally, authentication header can be provided to use additional CIF features that require authentication.

### Connect AEM to the commerce system

To connect your project to the commerce system AEM must be configured with the GraphQL endpoint of your commerce system. 

Both, a project generated by the [AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype) or the [AEM Venia Reference Store](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-guides-venia), already include a [default config](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-guides-venia/blob/main/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/venia/osgiconfig/config/com.adobe.cq.commerce.graphql.client.impl.GraphqlClientImpl~default.cfg.json) which must be adjusted.

Replace the value of the `url` in `com.adobe.cq.commerce.graphql.client.impl.GraphqlClientImpl~default.cfg.json` with the GraphQL endpoint of your commerce system used by the project. This configuration can be done via the OSGI console or by deploying the OSGI configuration via the project. Different configurations for to connect staging or production systems can be used as well via different AEM run modes.

The AEM Commerce Add-On and CIF Core Components connect to the commerce GraphQL endpoint via the AEM server and directly via the browser. Client-side CIF Core Components and CIF Add-On authoring tools by default connect to `/api/graphql`. If needed this can be adjusted via the CIF Cloud Service config (see below).

The CIF add-on provides a GraphQL proxy servlet at `/api/graphql` which can optionally be used for [local development](develop.md). For production deployments it is strongly recommended to setup a reverse proxy to the commerce GraphQL endpoint via the AEM Dispatcher or at other network layers (like CDN).

## Configuring stores and catalogs {#catalog}

The CIF add-on and the [CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) can be used on multiple AEM site structures connected to different commerce stores (or store views, etc). By default, the CIF add-on is deployed with a default config connecting to Adobe Commerce's default store and catalog (Magento).

This configuration can be adjusted for the project via the CIF Cloud Service config following these steps:

1. In AEM go to Tools -> Cloud Services -> CIF Configuration

2. Select the commerce configuration you want to change

3. Open the configuration properties via the action bar

![CIF Cloud Services Configuration](/help/commerce/cif/assets/cif-cloud-service-config.png)

The following properties can be configured:

- GraphQL Client - select the configured GraphQL client for commerce backend communication. This should typically stay at default.
- Store View - the (Magento) store view identifier. If empty, the default store view will be used.
- GraphQL Proxy Path - the URL path GraphQL Proxy in AEM use to proxy requests to the commerce backend GraphQL endpoint.
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > In most setups the default value `/api/graphql` must not be changed. Only advanced setup not using the provided GraphQL proxy should change this setting.
- Enable Catalog UID Support - enable support for UID instead of ID in the commerce backend GraphQL calls.
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Support for UIDs got introduced in Adobe Commerce (Magento) 2.4.2. Only enable this if your commerce backend supports a GraphQL schema of version 2.4.2 or later.
- Catalog Root Category Identifier - the identifier (UID or ID) of the store catalog root

The configuration shown above is for reference. Projects should provide thier own configurations.

For more complex setups using multiple AEM site structures combined with different commerce catalogs see the [Commerce Multi-Store Setup](configuring/multi-store-setup.md) tutorial.
