# Contributing to Adobe Experience Manager Documentation

Thank you for choosing to contribute to Adobe Experience Manager documentation! Adobe welcomes content contributions from the entire reader community and from fellow Adobe employees.

This file describes how you can contribute and points out the guidelines to follow when making your contributions.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By contributing to AEM documentation, you agree to adhere to this code of conduct. Report unacceptable behavior to [Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com).

## Guidelines for Contributing

While we welcome any contributions to improve AEM documentation, we do ask that contributions adhere to certain guidelines and standards where possible. Review the [Guidelines for Contributing to AEM Documentation](guidelines.md) for more information.

## How to Contribute

We want to make it as easy as possible to submit your contributions. You can contribute in two ways:

* [Create an issue](#create-an-issue)
* [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request)

Which method you choose depends on how comfortable you are editing the documentation in GitHub yourself.

>[!NOTE]

>Contributions that you submit are covered by the [Adobe terms of use](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html).

### Create an Issue {#create-an-issue}

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? Then create an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contribute, but don't feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

Issues let you easily describe your idea for improvement to the docs and an AEM Docs Team member can review it. Simply click on the **Log an issue** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page to create an issue.

### Create a Pull Request {#create-a-pull-request}

If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests let you make your own edits to the documentation, which are then reviewed for inclusion by an AEM Docs Team member. Simply click the **Edit this page** link at the top of the right navigation panel on any page to make your suggested changes and create the pull request.

All pull requests must be accompanied by a signed [contributor license agreement or CLA](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html). This gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. You only need to submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go!

### Quick Video Introduction

Have a look at the following video for a quick overview of how to create issues and pull requests.

### Contributions from Adobe Employees

If you are an Adobe employee and have a contribution, use the `AdobeDocs` org in the corporate git.

We are happy for any contribution and will review your contribution if it is made on the public repository, however pull requests from Adobe employees are easier to process and can be approved faster on the corporate repo. Make sure that any proprietary information is only discussed on the corporate repo.
